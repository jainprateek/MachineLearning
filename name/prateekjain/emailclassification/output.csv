Defending a total of 72 runs\, which\, given the day's playing conditions was not as easy as it may be assumed\, MSUCC bowlers began their proceedings under immense pressure. Captain Mouthgalya bowled a fiery spell taking 4 wickets missing out on a hat-trick in his third over. RamMohan bowled an excellent spell\, missing out on a hat-trick\, taking three crucial wickets that put the UAT batsmen further in the back seat. Vice-Captain Hamanth Kalluri took 1 wicket. The game went into a nail-biting finish when the visiting team had to score 15 runs in the last 2 overs of their innings with 2 wickets in hand. MSUCC bowlers displayed courage and discipline as they pulled off a thriller finish\, containing the batsmen from scoring the runs they needed badly. The UAT batsmen stood there\, looking puzzled\, as they realized they were still short of their target by 7 runs when their innings ended. In the end\, it was MSUCC which emerged a deserving winner of this cracker of a match which had the final result uncertain until the last moment. With this 7-run victory over UAT\, which happens to be the second victory against UAT in the past 8 months\, MSUCC continues on its winning streak which began more than a year ago.

". a big score with 3 goals for the Brazilian side in the first half was enough to let anyone was watching the game between Egypt and Brazil in London in the Olympian games that It will be goals festival. the first half has been ended up with this result\, and Ramzi made the change with Salah to see that the Egyptian team is able to compete the Brazilian team and even able to change the game for his side. after scoring 2 goals and refreshing the hopes that the Egyptian team is able to draw and even to win\, all the people said one sentence " why you didn't push Salah in the game from the start ? ". the second half was like a copy of our last game with Brazil\, but the password this time was Salah who has been boasted by all the fans and the former Brazilian and Egyptian stars watching the game. Brazil couch has admitted that the game was so hard and Itwas about to be lost but they achieved what they were looking for and they won the game. also Romareo the Brazilian superstar boasted Salah and said that Salah made the difference in the second half. at 4:31 AM 0 comments Email This BlogThis!

MEDA - About Us / FAQ - Metro East Dart Association - Detroit\, Michigan\, USA Metro East Dart Association Metro East Dart Association - Detroit\, Michigan - Established 1991 MEDA on Facebook MEDA on Twitter MEDA on YouTube Statistics Standings Players Venues Schedule Tournaments Rules & By-Laws Featured Video FAQ About Us Metro East Dart Association is a Detroit-area steel-tipped dart league. Our objective is to sanction league play and work with similar organizations to advance the great game of darts. We were formed in September of 1991 from the remains of Pointes East Dart Association\, and have been in constant operation since then. There are two seasons per year: Fall (August-December) and Spring (January-May). The league plays every Wednesday at 8:00pm\, and there are fifteen games (eight 01/seven cricket) played per match in all divisions. The current membership fee for one full year (includes Fall and Spring seasons) is $45 per person\, and teams must pay a venue fee of $85 per team/per season. We have an open-bar banquet in June every year at which we award trophies for both team and individual accomplishments. M.E.D.A. is currently composed of 56 dart players on 10 different teams in 6 sponsoring venues. We are always looking to add new players\, teams\, and venues\, so please contact us at if interested. Upcoming Schedule / Events MEDA Executive Board Meeting Date / Location TBD Featured Video Check out MEDAs YouTube page for more steel-tipped darts related videos. Frequently Asked Questions Q: How much experience and/or skill do I need to join in your league? A: The league is very flexible  it obviously helps to have some knowledge of the game upon entry\, but we can accomodate any skill level\, from beginner to expert. The league is split into multiple divisions\, and we do our best to ensure that players are matched up against similarly skilled players. Q: Do I have to enter the league with a full team\, or can I sign up individually? A: If you want to bring in a full team\, that obviously must be done at the beginning of the season (teams are required to have four to six people). During the season\, we can almost always find a spot for an individual player of any skill level. Q: On what night and at what time does your league play? A: We play on most Wednesdays. League play starts at 8:00pm. Most players show up at least 10-15 minutes early to practice/warm up. Q: How much does it cost to join? A: The player fee is currently $45 per calendar year\, running from mid-August to mid-August. The cost of membership includes admission for one to our year-end banquet in June (extra tickets are available as well)\, and team and/or individual accomplishment trophies. The year is split into two seasons: FALL\, running from August to December\, and SPRING\, running from January to May. Q: Im interested in joining... whats my next step? A: Contact us by email at . Or show up at one of our registration meetings (in August or January). Our League Coordinator can help with placing you on a team. Q: Im interested in joining M.E.D.A. as a sponsor. What do I need to know? A: The current venue fee is $85 per team per season. This fee includes six to eight home matches (with a minimum of four people per team) and admission for one to our year-end banquet. There are two seasons per year: the fall season starting in August and the spring season starting in January. Its best to notify our League Coordinator first and well go from there. We generally accept venues in eastern Wayne County\, Macomb County\, and possibly the eastern end of Oakland County. Ample free parking is required\, and the venue must have adequate space for the dartboard\, scoreboard\, and participants. The league will be glad to help you set up (boards\, chalkboards\, and toelines\, etc) if you desire. All venues must be sanctioned for league play by our League Coordinator before each season. Q: Are there other Detroit-area steel-tipped dart leagues? A: Yes\, there are several - take a look at " Michigan Dart Leagues " in the right column on this page.

The Anstruther Golf Course Anstruther Golf Club Home Golf Course History Events Fixtures Clubhouse Gallery Links Contact Us Welcome to the Anstruther Golf Club Welcome to Anstruther Golf Club home of The Rockies voted the toughest par 3 in the UK by Todays Golfer in September 2007. Are you up for the challenge? Click here to see the article in full. Our philosophy is that we treat all of our guests as members and a truly warm Anster welcome awaits all visiting golfers. Anstruther Golf Club was founded in 1890 and has seen many changes over the years. The initial layout comprised 7 holes with trenches through the middle of the course and poles scattered over the greens to stop gliders landing during the war. In more peaceful times the course was extended to an excellent 9 holes which is kept in superb condition throughout the year. The course is located 9 miles south of St Andrews and stretches along the shoreline between Anstruther and Pittenweem. The spectacular views over Anstruther Harbour and out to the Isle of May\, Bass rock and south west to Edinburgh are a constant distraction. Golfers should beware of Anstruther Golf Clubs version of Amen corner which comprises a series of 3 challenging par 3s starting with The Rockies (5th) voted the toughest par 3 in the UK! John Anderson\, former Executive Chef at the "...House" Restaurants in St Andrews\, has taken over the Rockies Restaurant. In addition to serving snacks and bar meals throughout the day\, he provides a la carte Lunches and Dinners in the Restaurant with seafood featuring strongly in most of his menu s.

I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season.' Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck said: 'This is a very significant day for Chelsea\, capturing one of the best players in the world with his peak years ahead of him. We have long admired the talents of a player who is a proven goalscorer in English football and Fernando's arrival is a sign of our continuing high ambitions. I hope every Chelsea fan is as excited as I am with this news.' Chief executive Ron Gourlay added: 'Signing a player of the stature of Fernando Torres benefits the club on many levels. Carlo Ancelotti was keen to add his talents to the squad as we continue our quest for three trophies this season\, we are delighted we have succeeded with that wish\, and this signing will undoubtedly aid the club in realising our worldwide potential - on and off the pitch.' Torres's scoring pedigree in English football is without doubt. The 26-year-old netted 65 goals in 102 league appearances for Liverpool and 81 in 142 games in all competitions. He moved to the Premier League aged 23 having spent the previous 12 years at Atletico Madrid\, a club based a few miles from the town of his birth on the outskirts of the capital city. In his time at Atletico\, 'El Nino' (The Kid - his nickname in Spain) was the club's youngest player and youngest captain. His debut came aged 17 and he took the armband two years later. His first full season was a quiet start with just six goals from 36 league appearances but that became 13 from 29 games the next year and the 20-goal mark was reached in 2003/04\, Torres's most prolific season in Spain and the year of his debut for the national side. The player's subsequent emergence on the international stage and 75 goals in 174 Spanish top-flight games meant many clubs across Europe were after his signature but he chose to work under compatriot Rafael Benitez at Liverpool. The transfer in July 2007 was valued at approximately 20 million\, Luis Garcia going the other way\, and Torres's first goal for the Merseysiders was against Chelsea at Anfield\, opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw after getting the better of Tal Ben-Haim. It was the first of seven goals in seven games against Chelsea. It is his best return against any English club. He scored three hat-tricks on the way to 33 goals in his first season in England\, becoming the first Liverpool player since a previous wearer of the number 9 shirt\, Robbie Fowler\, to break the 30-goal mark in one season. His second season returned 17 goals (injury reducing his number of appearances) as his side finished second\, three points and one place above Chelsea in the league table. Last season\, despite Liverpool dropping down the table to seventh\, Torres accumulated a very healthy 22 goals in 32 games. He headed to the World Cup in South Africa already a winner of the European Championships at senior international level. In his teenage years\, Torres had achieved top-scorer status for his country in both the Under 16 and Under 19 European Championships and he scored his first goal for the senior side against Italy aged 20\, seven months after his first cap. In the 2006 World Cup in Germany he scored three times in the group stage but Spain were beaten by France in the first knockout round. However there was no stopping his nation two years later at Euro 2008\, Torres scoring once on the way to the final and the only goal in that match in Vienna as Germany were defeated. It was Spain's first major piece of silverware since 1964. Last summer in South Africa\, Torres struggled for full fitness and form during the World Cup having undergone surgery in April. As a result\, Barcelona's Pedro took his place for a semi-final triumph over Germany. Coach Vicente Del Bosque also left Torres out of the starting line-up for the final. Instead he came on in extra-time in the 1-0 win over Holland although he tore a muscle before the end. Back in England this season and before joining the Blues\, Torres made 26 appearances for Liverpool\, scoring 11 times including both goals in Chelsea's November defeat at Anfield. From CleaseaFC.com Bookmark This Post Fernando Torres fears he's running out of time at Liverpool 0 Comments Published by Blogger on Monday\, January 31\, 2011 at 11:10 AM. So how long was Fernando Torres to wait\, then? He has given Liverpool a raw deal for the best part of a year now and this does him no credit. Yet look at the seemingly inevitable transfer request from his point of view. He is 26. The ensuing four years could be as good as it gets for him. Can he really afford to gamble on Liverpool's next roll of the dice coming up aces?   The restoration of Kenny Dalglish? It is meaningless to Torres right now. Dalglish might be an excellent influence\, but Liverpool's hierarchy cannot even guarantee that he will be manager beyond May because they are yet to back him with a permanent role.  We all think he will get the job and most hope so. He seems the right fit.Yet the initial intention of New England Sports Ventures was to appoint a younger man\, long term\, and there has so far been no announcement to the contrary. Torres is currently being asked to throw in his lot with a caretaker. Liverpool are not yet a stable club. Back firing: Fernando Torres returned to form against Chelsea in November\, but this column (below right) asked why True\, neither are Chelsea. Carlo Ancelotti's future is far from settled if he fails to deliver one of the biggest prizes this season. Yet Chelsea do have visible and finite prospects; not least a last-16 Champions League place and a favourable draw against FC Copenhagen.  These are the sort of possibilities Torres saw for Liverpool when he signed his contract in May 2009. He thought they were a club that would be in contention for the domestic title and the Champions League; instead\, from that moment\, the place headed steadily downhill.  A graph drawn from that date would show Liverpool bouncing around between 11th and third in the early weeks of last season\, before flat-lining around the Europa League positions from roughly the 10th match onwards. This season's figures are worse. Liverpool near the bottom and then suspended in mid-table mediocrity. Their present league position is the highest of the campaign: seventh again.  This was not the brochure\, as advertised. Torres signed after a season in which Liverpool finished second to Manchester United by four points and at last showed championship potential under Rafael Benitez. By the end of that summer\, however\, their great midfield provider\, Xabi Alonso\, had been sold to Real Madrid and the relationship with Benitez began to sour as results slumped.  We now know the striker was angling to leave for Chelsea before this season began. He became a lethargic\, sulking shadow of commitment under Roy Hodgson - except for one game against his present suitors and we understand the reason for that now - and the fancy that he would be inspired by the arrival of Liverpool hero Dalglish turned out to be just that.  As Alan Shearer discovered during his brief tenure at Newcastle United\, local heroes do not count for much these days when most of the dressing room hold a foreign passport.  Dalglish's return was a feel-good tale for the romantics at Anfield but the belief that Torres was among them has not lasted.  As a professional\, he will only indulge that side of his nature for so long. Suggs from Madness wrote an FA Cup final song for Chelsea in 1997 called Blue Day. 'We've waited so long but we'll wait for ever\,' it goes. That is the difference between fans and footballers. Fans can wait for ever\, and do. Footballers\, the best ones certainly\, have a biological clock that starts ticking with an imperative to win trophies in the late twenties.  Having dedicated his young life to a labour of love\, Atletico Madrid\, and then been equally moved by Liverpool's story\, Torres is now looking after No 1.   He has not behaved well\, there is no doubt of that. His performances this season have been indolent\, and the timing of this episode - on the day the 23m signing of Luis Suarez was announced\, at the end of the transfer window when there is precious little time for a club to respond to the loss of a major player\, and with the match against Chelsea 10 days away - is crass.  Yet the cynicism of those who presume this means the last four seasons have been an act is overplayed. It was two years ago that Torres was interviewed in these pages. Some of his words are now being recycled to prove a charge of hypocrisy. Torres talked of Liverpool in emotive terms\, saying he had watched DVDs and read books about the history of the club with his girlfriend in their Merseyside apartment. He said Liverpool was now his English club\, the way Atletico will remain his Spanish club. 'I would not like to play for another in England or Spain\,' he said.  This is damning stuff\, in the present circumstances. Yet I have no doubt he meant it. He did see Liverpool as a cause\, much like Atletico\, he did appreciate its uniqueness. The club lost its way long before Torres did. Another observation from that day is not being so widely circulated\, perhaps because it does not support the party line of Torres as rotten turncoat. 'A player wants to be remembered for what he has won\, for the medals\, for what he has given his club\,' Torres said. 'Imagine 10 years after you stop playing\, you go back\, you look around\, you are not in any picture\, you have no medals\, no trophies; it is like you played for nothing.'  He was speaking in support of Kaka's decision to reject Manchester City\, but this could be the epitaph for his Liverpool career\, too. Torres has won nothing since joining the club.  The only competition left for him this season is the moribund Europa League and if Dalglish could ensure Liverpool qualify for that competition next season\, too\, he would be considered to have done a very good job.  For Torres\, it is not enough. He sees his stage as the Champions League\, not its scrawny cousin\, and how long until Liverpool are part of Europe's elite again?  Much is being made of the recent back-to-back wins under Dalglish but while Wolverhampton Wanderers were despatched efficiently enough\, Fulham were only overcome by a John Pantsil own goal at Anfield.  Is this any more significant than the run between October 24 and November 7 this season\, when Liverpool recorded straight wins over Blackburn Rovers\, Bolton Wanderers\, Napoli and Chelsea? It is flimsy evidence on which to base such a weighty decision.  Dream partnership: Idealists would like to see Dalglish and Torres working together So now the propaganda war begins. The Holy Grail for every selling club these days is the cash and a crucifixion. They want to be able to take the money but to do so from a position of moral superiority in which the player alone is blamed (think of Wayne Rooney's departure from Everton\, or every outgoing transfer from Arsenal\, and you get the idea).  So now we hear that Torres was an unpopular team member with an inflated salary\, his own physiotherapist and even had an operation tailored to suit his World Cup commitments. Imagine that?  Imagine a player so self-obsessed that he prioritises winning the World Cup over the kudos of emerging victorious from the bitter fight for seventh place? Had Liverpool been challenging for the title\, one assumes he might have felt differently.  Down-hearted: Torres has cut a lonely figure at Anfield this season Idealists - and not just Liverpool fans - would like to see Dalglish and Torres together for longer. The manager is a wonderful tutor for any striker. Ask Shearer. He credits Dalglish with a tip that changed his career at Blackburn.  Dalglish noticed in training that his new signing was having a lot of his shots blocked. So he told him to shape to shoot\, but delay striking the ball for a split second. That way\, said Dalglish\, the defender would stretch out a leg to make the stop\, leaving a gap through which the ball could be hit. In turn\, the goalkeeper would then see the shot late\, making it harder to adjust his position to save.  Shearer admitted it was a difficult skill to master but\, once achieved\, he never looked back. One cannot help but think that in their short time together Torres has not yet taken all Dalglish has to give.  Yet even if Dalglish can improve Torres's game\, can he transform Liverpool's before another season passes unfulfilled? It is unlikely and that is the crux of the matter. In a season in which Cesc Fabregas\, Rooney and Carlos Tevez have all tried the patience of their clubs\, Torres may be the odd man out in actually forcing a move.  Arsenal\, Manchester United and Manchester City all persuaded their players to stay by convincing them that better times were around the corner. Chelsea did the same with John Terry two summers ago.  If Liverpool sell Torres\, therefore\, it means that the management do not think this is a problem that can be resolved. In their minds\, the Torres transfer issue will resurface next summer or next season\, as a constant distraction. This means they\, too\, have doubts that they can keep the player happy\, short-term.   So Torres's view\, and the executive view\, of Liverpool are not all that different. He does not know how long he will have to wait to return to the elite and neither do they. If they did\, they wouldn't sell. from dailymail.co.uk Bookmark This Post => /Top/Shopping/Antiques_And_Collectibles/Phonograph

Everything Sabonis Sign In Sign-Up Search the Web Search Welcome! Close Would you like to make this site your homepage? It's fast and easy... Yes\, Please make this my home page! No Thanks  Don't show this to me again. Close   Site Update: I added the new the article Sabonis\, an MVP and more to Kaunas and the photos from the slideshow. Much thanks for Fiona for getting the pictures :) I added new photos in Off Court & Sabonis and Zalgiris. I added new articles including Lithuanian Basketball 'God' Returns to Moscow and All-time NBA all-star snubs  Sabonis Update: Well\, I don't know what there is to update. Sabas hasn't played at all this season and rumor has it that he might retire while other folks are saying he's going to try and go one more season. In other news\, Zalgiris made it to the Top 16. I haven't been watching them closely so I can't truthfully tell you how they are playing or how far they will advance. That's all for know but I will look to start updating and adding more pictures soon. Sabonis Update: I am sure all of you either watched or already heard about the heartbreaking loss to Maccabi . Sabas had 29 points and 9 boards but unfortunately fouled out in the 4th quarter. I know everyone is blaming Gustas for this loss but I don't think they should. I will admit that I was angry at first\, like everyone else but I got over it (being a Jayhawk fan I'm use to heartbreaking loses) and I am sure you all will to. However everyone needs to understand that Zalgiris lost as a team and\, if they won\, it would have been as a team. Theodore Roosevelt summed up the way I feel about all athletes (and especially Mr. Gustas at the moment) better then anyone has before or sense. "It is not the critic who counts\, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena\, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms\, the great devotions\, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who\, if he wins\, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who\, if he fails\, at least fails while daring greatly\, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat." - Theodore Roosevelt Beautiful\, yeah? Sabonis Update: Sabonis and Zalgiris Beat Maccabi On Thursday. Sabas had 11 points and 12 rebounds in the win. Ed Cota added 14\, 5\, and 4 for the victors. Before the game Sabas was offically awarded the MVP award by Euroleague CEO Jordi Bertomeu. Zalgiris next plays at Pamesa on Thursday. If you would like to chat with other fans during the game then download a IRC client such as mIRC or Bersirc IRC Client (I highly recommend this one) and view this thread which will give you details on how to set up the chat (it's really very easy to set up but I am BAD that giving instructions). Sabonis Update: Sabonis & Zalgiris Beat Ulker on Thursday . Sabas had 25 points\, 16 rebounds\, 4 assists\, and a overall rating of 47 which is the highest index rating ever in a Top 16 game. Zalgiris next faces Maccabi at home. If you would like to chat with other fans during the game then download a IRC client such as mIRC or IceChat IRC Client and view this thread which will give you details on how to set up the chat (it's really very easy to set up but I am BAD that giving instructions). Sabonis Update: When Sabas announced that he was going to play for Zalgiris I heard people say that he wouldn't have an impact because he was to old. Well\, on Friday he officially proved them wrong when he won the Euroleague MVP award . In other Sabonis related news\, Zalgiris moved on to the Top 16 Tournament despite losing to CSKA on a last secound three . Sabas had 12 points\, 9 boards\, and 4 assists in the loss. Zalgiris beat Krka 65-72 behind Arvydas Sabonis. Sabas had 17 points\, 7 boards\, and 2 blocks on 7/10 overall shooting. Dainius Salenga added 14 points & 6 rebounds in the win. In other news Sabas did in interview for the Respublika in which he talks about the blackmail scandal. You can view the interview here . If you have any questions about the interview please see this tread on Interbasket.net. Feel free to post any questions or comments you have. Thanks to Butters for translating the interview :) Well\, just when you think that things can't get worse for Zalgiris after a loss to Tel Aviv you find out the Lietuvos rytas newspaper is trying to blackmail businesses out of sponsoring Zalgiris. Sabonis came forward with this news in an interview with Respublika before his team traveled to Israel for a game against Tel Aviv. According to Mr. Sabonis when he contacted a business man about becoming a Zalgiris sponsor the business man told him that he would have to talk to the Rytas paper first. Arvydas wonderd why this was and found out when the business man later explained that owner of the Rytas paper and basketball team threatened to write atrocious things about his company if he agreed to sponsor Zalgiris and not give Rytas money. Sabas also mentioned that there is still more to this story and will tell everything once he gets back from playing in Israel. If you would like to e-mail the Rytas newspaper in response to this deceitful tactic you can reach them at daily@lrytas.lt Sabonis Update: He's back! After 2 weeks in bed recovering from bronchitis Sabas made he's triumphant return to lead Zalgiris in a 89-81 win over Unicaja Malaga . Sabonis lead the team with 23 points\, 8 boards\, and 4 blocks. Mindaugas Timinskas also played well for Zalgiris and added 16 points\, 8 boards\, and 4 assists. Sabas was the decisive force in the final minutes as he hit a three and lead his team to a 7-0 run that sealed the game for Zalgirs. Sabonis Update: Sabas scored 18 points in a lose to Panathinaikos . Sabonis and the rest of the Zalgiris team where clearly rusty after an 18 day break between games which resulted in 20 turnovers compared to only 5 for their opponents. Zalgiris plays again on Saturday when they face Sakalai Vilnius in the Lithuanian League. Sabonis Update: Sabas scored 19 points and grabbed 8 boards in a loss to CSKA Moscow . Ed Cota added 14 for Zalgiris. Site Update: I have updated the chat and forum . Check them out. They are pretty cool and you do not need to register to use either feature. Sabonis Update: New Sabas interview ! He talks about his kids\, European basketball\, and much more. Overall very good interview and a must read. PS- thanks to CFFI for the heads up! Update: I only got two words for you. New videos ... ok I have more then two words. I also want to thank Joker over at InterBasket for making the videos. Thanks Joker :) Hi\, my name is Erin and this is my site devoted to Arvydas Sabonis. The world famous Lithuania basketball star and one of the best players to play the game. Arvydas is curretly playing for the team he grew up with and now owns BC Zalgiris. He is doing very well playing for the team. So far in EuroLeague he is averaging 15.5 PPG and 12 RPG and is the leading the MVP rankings. Zalgiris is 4-3 in Euroleague play and 17-1 in LKL making them 21-4 overall. Sabonis use to play for Real Madrid and the Portland Trailblazers If you want to get your site seen and you have a basketball site for International basketball players and clubs then check out International Basketball Sites .

Gracie USA Jiu-Jitsu Home Page This is the Official Gracie Web Site\, and the Home of Gracie USA It is with heavy heart that we note the passing of the legendary GrandMaster Carlson Gracie\, who passed away February 1 in Chicago\, Illinois\, at the age of 72. He will be missed by all who knew him. The Gracie style of Jiu-Jitsu is the "hottest" item in martial arts today. The Gracie style was created in the early part of this century by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu pioneer Carlos Gracie \, who had a standing challenge that was open to practitioners of all styles\, regardless of size\, weight or musculature. "IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR FACE BEATEN AND WELL SMASHED\, YOUR ____ KICKED\, AND YOUR ARMS BROKEN\, CONTACT CARLOS GRACIE AT THIS ADDRESS . . . " -- Brazilian newspaper ad\, circa 1920s This tradition of open challenge has been continued by the Gracie family and their students\, and the Gracie style is recognized to be the most effective fighting art in the world . . . both in the ring and on the street! . . . a fact that the Gracie family and their students have been proving through their standing challenge for over 70 years. The Gracie USA Jiu-Jitsu Home Page is your #1 Web source for accurate and up-to-date information and links about this fascinating and effective fighting art\, and the family that made it. Contents include: About the Gracie style of Jiu-Jitsu Gracie Family Members on the Web The Gracie Family including the Official Federation Belt Rankings of Gracie members teaching in the U.S. and the Real Gracie Family Tree The Gracie Diet new info added 10/8/96 Vale Tudo & No Rules Fighting Events Links to Non-Gracie Sources Gracie Family Members on the Web Three of the greatest Gracie fighters who have taught in the U.S.! Carley Gracie -- 8th degree red-and-black belt; undefeated former Brazilian champion in both sport Jiu-Jitsu and Vale Tudo; considered to be the most technical of the Gracie fighters. Carlson Gracie -- 9th degree red belt; former Brazilian champion who defeated Waldemar Santana only months after Santana's victory over Helio Gracie. Carlson Gracie passed away February 1\, 2006. Rickson Gracie -- currently competing in Brazil and Japan The Gracie Family The real Gracie Family Tree (no holds barred) Martial Arts Genealogy of key Gracie Family Members -- who learned from whom Official Federation Belt Rankings of Gracie Family Members and others teaching in the U.S. (from Rio de Janeiro\, Brasil) Gracie Family Academies and other places to study the Gracie style in the U.S. (an unofficial listing) The Gracie Diet The Gracie Diet is not just about fruits \, it's about how you combine the foods you eat. Meats are a part of the Gracie Diet. Most meats (as well as fish\, fowl and shellfish) are in Group A. The Group A foods combine with each other as well as with one food from Group B. Tip of the Week: Some foods do not combine with other foods\, and have to be eaten alone. In the Gracie Diet\, these are called Group D foods. When you eat one of these foods\, wait 3-4 hours for your body to digest it before you eat something different. Some of the fruits and other foods that must be eaten alone include: Apples (if green or acidic)\, apricots\, cherries\, peaches\, acidic plums\, acidic pears Blackberries\, raspberries\, strawberries Pineapple\, mango Grapefruit\, lemon\, orange\, tangerine Yogurt\, kefir\, acidophilus milk Note\, none of the individual fruits and foods listed above combines with any other food or even with each other . That means don't blend the juices of different citrus fruits\, don't combine blackberries with raspberries\, and watch the blend in fruit salad\, if you want to follow the Gracie Diet. Check our page on Gracie Diet Tips for a more complete list of Group D foods (the ones that must be eaten alone)\, as well as more information about the Gracie Diet\, getting started\, and the basic rule about (not) combining carbohydrates. Vale Tudo & No Rules Fighting Events Gracie techniques have been publicized in numerous magazine articles\, and their effectiveness has been publicly demonstrated in Carlos Gracie's Brazilian TV Series "Heroes of the Ring" \, public competitions and challenge matches\, and videos\, as well as in recent pay-per-view and foreign TV broadcasts that include fight events such as Pride (in Japan and other venues) the Ultimate Fighting Championship series In these and other events\, Gracie representatives\, fighting in "no rules" open competition against title holders of other martial arts styles\, have consistently won their matches continuing to prove that the Gracie style of Jiu-Jitsu is the most effective fighting art in the world today.

The England players\, mouths dry with fear\, looked for escape routes - or even potential weapons - in case the mob fell on them. Bowler Harold Larwood\, the focus of the fury\, turned to team-mate Les Ames. "If they come\," he said\, "you can take the leg stump for protection - I'll take the middle." Never before or since that moment\, 80 years ago to the day\, on 16 January 1933\, had cricket - and arguably any other sport - seen a contest which fired such anger\, which reached so far and echoed for so long\, as the Bodyline tour. Bodyline used a more aggressive but still legal method of bowling. "In Australia to this day\, the word Bodyline carries the stench of underhand or unsportsmanlike behaviour; with the series regarded as Australian cricket's most controversial\," said David Studham from the Australian National Sports Museum. The view of the MCC\, which organised the tour\, is slightly different. The curator of its museum\, Adam Chadwick\, said: "Was Bodyline unsportsmanlike? By the standards of the day\, yes. By the standards of now\, it was a stroke of genius." 'Devastatingly fast' At the beginning of the 1930s\, the MCC - Marylebone Cricket Club - still ruled the cricketing world from its seat at Lord's in London. But it had a problem\, in the shape of batting phenomenon Don Bradman. During their 1930 tour of England\, Australia - the arch rivals - had dominated the home bowlers\, with Bradman averaging a staggering 139.14. The MCC looked to austere amateur player Douglas Jardine for an answer\, making him England captain. Jardine believed Bradman struggled against balls which bounced into his chest and formed a tactic to exploit this. But the plan needed the right bowler\, and that bowler was former Nottinghamshire miner Harold Larwood. Duncan Hamilton\, Larwood's biographer\, said: "He had two things. Firstly he was incredibly accurate\, he claimed never to have bowled a wide in his career\, and accuracy was essential to Bodyline. Cricket genius - Larwood and Bradman duelled during Bodyline but faced very different fates in t => /Top/Shopping/Crafts/Nature/Antler_Art

Big reward for a lot of hard work from the design and shore teams is tearing around the bay at over 30 knots. Heres a look at the revamped Oracle 4: Posted in General | Leave a reply Videos from Moth Worlds in Australia Posted on January 23\, 2015 by Andrew Reply We had a great couple weeks in Sorrento\, Victoria for the 2015 Moth World Championships this month. The team committed to the idea of training for the regatta this past year before we moved to the venue for the next Americas Cup\, so we were excited to see where we stood along side some of the best Moth sailors around the world. The regatta was a bit of a bust from the conditions-side of things. The steady sea breezes never really set up while we were racing and we instead had to battle either very light air or heavy air against a significant amount of tide on Port Phillip Bay. Big chop a and heavy air are two things that the Moth doesnt like\, but it made for some spectacular sailing and even more wild wipeouts and crashes. The light air races really didnt help my scores\, being one of the bigger guys in the fleet\, but I learned a massive amount about what equipment I can add to the boat to make light air sailing easier. Ultimately\, the moth class is and equipment game. The boat is very dependentto the settings and tuning\, but also having the correct foils for the conditions. Having just my one set\, and fairly stock equipment\, I was really happy to meet my two goals: finish in Gold Fleet\, and finish every race. The final race of the regatta was 25 knots in nastychop\, and it was a total battle of man against the machine against the elements. So to take a top 40 result is pleasing\, but leaves me plenty of room for improvement. Luckily Ill have plenty of other sailing to do coming up to take my mind off of the moth. Were heading to San Francisco here in February for our last training camp before we set up shop in Bermuda in May. Enjoy some of the video from the event:  Posted in General | Leave a reply Videos from Lake Macquarie Posted on August 26\, 2014 by Andrew Reply Couple video updates from our recent moth sailing in Lake Macquarie\, Australia.

CISA has been running this clinic for 30 years\, and ABYC goes above and beyond to give us the best possible venue for this great event. Ive been lucky to have been involved directing the last 6 clinics. This year we had 108 sailors\, ages 14 to 18 in six classes: 29er\, International 420\, Laser\, Laser Radial\, Club 420 and FJ. They were accompanied by 17 world class coaches (listed below). Four days long\, the clinic put the sailors to the test. Daily fitness regimen with Harry Legum from Annapolis Sailing Fitness primed the sailors for what Olympic-level training camps will be like in their not-to-distant future. The format of the clinic broke from tradition slightly this year. To give the sailors and coaches one more day of clinic\, we removed the race day from the schedule and enabled the coaches to come up with scores from drills\, racing and efforts throughout the week.A competitive atmosphere simply dominated the clinic. Sailors were rewarded for their hard word throughout the week rather than just the final day. I am curious to hear the feedback from the sailors and coaches\, but I was really impressed by the improved environment. We were also fortunate to have four great speakers in the evenings of the clinic. Pete Melvin\, an Olympic Tornado sailor\, naval architect\, and CISA board member gave a great presentation on his work designing the 34th and 35th Americas Cup rules\, as well as his experience with Emirates Team New Zealand. Heres the video of his presentation: Sunday evening we had one of this weeks I420 coaches and Quantum Racing afterguard member Tom Burnham give some fantastic insight into successful team management and campaign management. Coaches and sailors alike were taking notes throughout that one! Monday we had a brief but lively speech from renowned speaker and sailor Dave Perry who brought over some friends from the Congeressional Cup: Americas Cup winner Dave Dellenbaugh\, youth champion Becca Dellenabugh\, and current Match Race World Champion Taylor Canfield. The sailors were full of questions and buzzing about match racing and how to get involved. For the final two days of the clinic we had the great support of US Olympic Technical Director Fuzz Spanhake as well as Olympic Coach and Youth Development Director Leandro Spina\, fresh off the plane from Sailing World Cup Palma de Mallorca. Fuzz gave a great slide show on sail controls and followed up with many classes\, providing some eye-opening technical knowledge applicable to each group. I quickly want to thank those involved with running the clinic: ABYCs Membership and Staff are phenomenal\, ABYC is simply the best training ground in the world\, bar none. Our Sponsors: Ayers Hotels\, Gill North America\, and Kaenon Polarized CISAs administrative staff continue to pull together this clinic to much success. The CISA board does much to organize and provide vision for the clinic and the CISA Foundation. We had a massive cadre of volunteers in many functions this week: Housing sailors\, Running the lunch and dinner service\, Pulling dollies\, Fueling coach boats\, Scoring\, and other countless supporting efforts. Local Yacht Clubs provide coach boats and equipment: NHYC\, USSC Long Beach\, LBYC\, and of course ABYC. Lastly\, I want to thank a phenomenal Coaching Staff.Their professionalism and effort through the four days make the clinic run smoothly\, but also push the sailors to make improvements that they didnt know were possible. That inspiration is what we strive for a this event\, and the staff was of truly the highest caliber: Laser Coaches: Robbie Dean & Mike Kalin Laser Radial Coaches: David Wright\, Lisa Ross\, & Ryan Minth 29er Coaches: Cameron Biehl & Zach Brown I420 Coaches: Sydney Bolger & Tom Burnham C420 Coaches: Joey Mello\, Steph Roble\, & Jay Kehoe FJ Coaches: Zack Maxam & Jimmer Montgomery Fitness Coach: Harry Legum Technical Coaches: Leandro Spina & Fuzz Spanhake Thanks all.

Badgers Cricket Club home page Badgers Cricket Club Affiliated to the CCC Home Page Home Clubhouse News Fixtures Results Averages Club Officers Hall Of Fame  Links  A warm and friendly welcome from Badgers Cricket Club  a wandering cricket side who play only friendly cricket matches\, mostly in the villages of Surrey  and who also enjoy a yearly three day tour (for many years to the Cotswolds\, briefly to Dorset and more recently to Cheshire). For more information about the club and this web site\, take a peek at the about page . The site has continued to grow since it first appeared in March 2000\, and in addition to up-to-the-minute results \, scorecards \, match reports \, news and fixtures \, you will also find more statistical information than you could shake a stick at\, the Badgers  hall of fame \, a list of the current club officers \, a sadly rather stagnant photo gallery and links to general cricket sites and many of the clubs that we play\, or have played\, against. Free T20 Blast tickets As a result of affiliating ourselves to the Surrey Cricket Board this season we have been given a block of T20 Blast tickets for the Wednesday 1st July game against Gloucestershire which starts at 18:30 (6.30pm) at the Oval. Any paid up club member that would like to claim one of these tickets then please contact skipper Mark. Once the members have had first dibs then there will probably be tickets left to share out to family members and friends. Whats New 23 May 2015 Sadly we had a cry off from this weeks scheduled opponents Dormansland at ten past nine last night but I have managed to arrange an alternative fixture with Whiteley Village CC. I may find time to add links and fixture page changes\, but for now this is it. 17 May 2015 The new season got underway\, after the first game on the slate was cancelled due to our inability to field a side (although we wouldnt have played anyway since Beechwoods replacement fixture was called off due to the weather)\, with an entertaining draw against Weybridge Vandals and a good run chase to snatch the victory on Ham Common. The usual summarised details of the games can be found on the results page along with a full match report for Weybridge and the pertinent elements from the scorecards . Hopefully a match report of some sort for the Ham & Petersham game will follow at some point. Over the course of the last few months I have gradually found just about enough time to finish off the addition of full information for 1985. That means that there is now a season report \, scorecards \, more comprehensive historical results \, complete full batting \, full bowling and miscellaneous statistics tables and a list of best performances plus concomitant updates to the personal pages . The inevitable discrepancies were found between the newly entered data and that already published\, the gory details of which can be found on the newly instituted Statistical Sett page which will be the new home of such detailed trivia from now on\, to avoid cluttering up this section with a load of verbiage that very few (if any) actually bother to read. It is probably worth pointing out at this point that the site rollover to a new season and the additional of an historical season both entail lots of updates under the covers. Whilst I have tried to check as much as possible prior to upload\, if you see anything that looks amiss then please let me know so that I can fix it. 21 Apr 2015 Bad news folks\, we have been unable to raise a team for this coming Sundays fixture with Beechwood so I have been forced to cry off and give them as much time as possible to arrange an alternative opponent. 18 Apr 2015 Once again this update really ought to have appeared more quickly after the AGM so some of what it reports is rather belated. The most out-dated of the news page entries is the information on indoor nets \, which finish this coming Thursday\, but there is also a summary report of the AGM for those that werent there (or for those that were and cannot remember that far back). The fixtures page has also been updated\, with the fixture list distributed at the AGM and updated a couple of times since\, replete with map links\, and Ive created the now usual Google map with the locations of our 2015 opposition . The first game of the season is just over a week away\, and it looks like we may be shy of players\, so please let me know your availability as soon as you can\, although hopefully I will be able to collect much of the missing information tomorrow at the pre-season BBQ at Marks. Oh\, and there will be another update along soon\, hopefully before the new season starts\, with the full details for the 1985 season which I have just finished cross-checking and finalising. Watch this space\, as they say. The older Whats New entries are now held on separate pages\, to keep this main page cleaner and smaller\, and you can also navigate to them using the Javascript menu (under Home).

Pasos On The Web! - Peruvian Paso Horse Resource    Click the pictures to see the online Photo Album    CLICK HERE TO ENTER SITE NEW - Peruvian Horse Lost and Found! Welcome to Peruvian Pasos on the Web! This website is an online resource library for the Peruvian Paso Horse. In addition to links to many Peruvian Paso ranches\, breeders\, owners\, haciendas\, regional clubs and national clubs\, and show information\, there are also sites related to the Paso Fino and other breeds.  Peruvian Paso Horses are medium size\, normally standing between 14.1 and 15.2 hands tall\, with a powerful build. They are similar in size to the Arabian and Morgan breeds. Peruvian breeders focus on temperament and gait as the most important characteristics. So expect to meet friendly\, level-headed horses\, that are a pleasure to be around. Purebred Peruvian Pasos are born with their ability to gait and show it off soon after they are born. Their gait is completely natural\, and they are shown barefoot\, which is a requirement for every show. Pasos come in many colors: chestnut\, black\, brown\, bay\, buckskin\, palomino\, gray\, roan or dun; with the solid colors\, grays and dark skin considered most desirable. The mane should be abundant\, lustrous and fine\, either curly or straight. The Peruvian Paso presents a noble\, arrogant appearance which makes him preferred for shows and parades. They are commonly seen in the famous Rose Parade! The Peruvian Paso horse should have an appearance of energy\, grace and refinement. Horses should have a well-developed muscular appearance without exaggerations. The head is of medium size with a straight or slightly concave profile; a small muzzle; oblong nostrils which extend easily; dark skin; dark expressive eyes set well apart; moderately marked jowls and medium length ears with fine tips curved slightly inward. The neck is of medium length with a graceful arch to the crest. It is slightly heavier in proportion to the body than with most light saddle breeds. The back is medium to short in length\, strong and rounded. Loins broad and well muscled over kidney area. Croup long and wide\, fairly muscular with moderate slope and nicely rounded. Tail is set low and viewed from the rear is carried straight\, quietly and held close to the buttocks. Chest is wide with abundant muscling. Rib cage well sprung and deep. The barrel is deep and the underline is nearly level from the last rib to the brisket. Flanks are moderately short\, full and deep. Quarters should be strong\, of medium roundness and width. Shoulders long\, very well inclined and well muscled\, especially at the withers. Bones of the lower limbs should be well aligned and well articulated so that the long bones line up with each other correctly above and below the joints with the skin tight against the bone and strong\, prominent tendons. Pasterns of medium length and springy but not showing weakness. Cannon bones are short. Slightly more angle to the hock than other light saddle breeds. Peruvian Paso Horses are bred for brio . Brio is often translated as "spirit\," but this does not capture the complexity of the term. Brio is a somewhat contradictory temperament\, which combines arrogance\, spirit\, and the sense of always being on parade\, with a willingness to please the rider. They have a zest for life and are curious about their surroundings\, but they are not spooky. The Peruvian Paso is one of the smoothest four beat gaited horses in the world. Descended from the horses of the Conquistadors\, Peruvian Paso horses possess the royal lineage of the noble Spanish breeds. A fiery spirit and gentle nature in a horse willing to work and just as eager to please. The Peruvian Paso horse is designed for the comfort and enjoyment of the rider. The gait accounts for the smooth ride. It is a four beat lateral pattern with the footfalls being : right hind -- right front -- left hind -- left front. The result is one of the smoothest rides of any breed of gaited horse. For riding pleasure\, the ultimate trail and pleasure horse is the Peruvian Paso horse. They are known as the Champagne Ride and you really can hold a glass of champagne and ride...without spilling a drop! The Peruvian Paso performs two executions of the four-beat gait. The first\, the isochronal (four equal beats). This is considered the preferred gait. The second\, the sobreandando \, is faster. Instead of four equal beats\, the lateral beats are closer together than in the paso llano \, and the pause between the fore of one side to the rear of the other side is longer. It is closer to a pure pace. Peruvians do well in Competitive Trail Riding\, distance and endurance riding\, and even foxhunting! There are also gaited mules out there\, so those that love the long ears will also enjoy a smooth ride! Also\, they are impressive drill team mounts. The Texas Ladies Aside performs on their beautiful Peruvian Paso horses. This site is a member of WebRing. To browse visit Here . This site is updated daily!

Peaks Coaching does an amazing job\, from the initial phone call with Kathy to the implementation and adaptation of the training plan! Killer cycling workouts\, I couldn't be happier" -Adam Bucklin "I wanted to give a shout out for the great cycling coaching I've been getting from Peaks. I am a 55 year old cyclist with mountain bike and cyclocross racing experience. In my first year with Peaks Coaching Group\, Sam helped me get my mountain bike racing back to a competitive state\, and he coached me to a real break out CX season\, taking me from mid/back of the pack to a regular podium finisher in the Mid-Atlantic region. I had an unfortunate injury\, literally on the eve of the season finale\, and Sam helped me through emotional and fitness recovery so that I was running on all cylinders for the next season.

Most of these injuries are traumatic brain injuries (TBI)\, caused by the lack of rider head protection. This exposure of the rider accounts for the particular types of injuries seen during these activities. Although the crash scenario often dictates the area of the body injured\, fatal crashes are most often a result of traumatic brain injury. Often these are isolated head injuries with no other serious injuries. Fatal traumatic brain injury occurs more often in adults than children\, although children are more often injured in bicycle crashes. This simply reflects the greater proportion of children using bicycles\, as well as the lack of experience of younger riders. Many studies have documented the particular risk of brain injury when riding a motorcycle. The increased speed of a motorcycle and use in vehicle traffic adds risk of injury far beyond that of a bicycle. Traumatic brain injury certainly can cause death\, but it also can cause disabling injuries that are extensive and require costly rehabilitation. For many people\, a brain injury triggers a significant change in lifestyle and function. Brain injury can vary from essentially minor disability to prolonged dependence on a ventilator to breathe\, and permanent loss of normal function. These serious brain injuries take a tremendous toll on families and others caring for an injured loved one.

There are 10 more restaurants that have 1 Michelin star. In the seaside restaurants you can taste the best seafood and fish while in "les masies" that are old farmhouses you can taste tradicional catalan dishes that in occasions can perfectly mix meat and fish. Populations: Some still retain the charm of old fishing villages like Begur\, Pals\, Cadaques\, Calella de Palafrugell or Tossa de Mar. Other villages instead have a more cosmopolitan tourism with a large number of bars and clubs such as Lloret de Mar and Platja d'Aro. Activities: Beach or mountain tourism. A few km from the Costa Brava you can find the ski stations of Vall Ter\, Nuria and La Molina. It is posible to practise sports such as windsurf or water-skiing\, skydiving and go- karting. There are plenty of routes for trekking or cycling on the coast and in the mountains. Culture: the Festival Jardins de Cap Roig that takes place in Calella de Palafrugell\, Castell de Peralada\, Porta Ferrada in Sant Feliu de Guixols. Dali Museum and Toy Museum in Figueres.

ArsenalTalk - Blogging by Gooners\, for Gooners! NO TIME Home League Table Contact Arsenal FC Capital One Cup Carling Cup Champions League England FA Cup Premier League Transfers Is Arsenal A Legitimate League Favourite? We've all enjoyed riding the recent hot streak for Arsenal\, and there's truly been some great football of late. For fans of the Gunners\, it's been something of a pleasant surprise. Following the club's frustrating inactivity during the summer\, when many thought transactions needed to be made\, Arsenal has jetted to the top of the Premier League standings\, and has of course made a major acquisition along the way in Mesut Ozil. But is it time to start looking at Arsenal as the legitimate favourites in the League? The betting odds\, if that's where you look for predictions\, still say no. ... Bendtner will stay Nicklas Bendtner will stay and play for Arsenal next season on the one hand due to the fact that the Gooners failed to find another striker. One the other hand due to the fact that the Dane has huge wage demands and therefore did not manage a transfer away. The chance for him to leave now is very small\, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said. If he comes back well and gets fit\, I will use him. In fact Bendtner currently earns 52000 a week.

View News Item   Club News over 3 years ago Laugharne 7pts Tycroes 15pts By David Pearce This was yet another sterling effort by this young Laugharne XV and despite the game being a fairly low scoring affair both sides put in a performance which was absorbing and competitve. To their credit both sides wanted to throw the ball about in ideal conditions on a well prepared and perfect playing surface. But at the end of the game Laugharne must have been seething with themselves for refusing to take two kickable penalties in the 2nd half which ultimately denied them a losing bonus point which they certainly deserved. This naivety will be overcome with more experience but this should not deter them\, as they as players are a cohesive and enthusiastic unit. Their team spirit is infectious and seems to bring out the best from them. View News Item   Club News over 3 years ago Tote Draw 11/09/12 By David Pearce The Winning no's were 33\, 39 & bonus No 18.

They returned the ball with interest forcing `Nant` to kick to touch. From the lineout 35m out from the `Nant` line which was well won by lock Carl Smith\, scrum half Gethin Jones got the ball away to flyhalf James Stephenson. Stephenson used centres Jon Owen and Liam Price in close proximity to probe into the `Nant` midfield. The ball was recycled quickly and scrum half Jones went right before finding Stephenson. Stephenson cleverly prised open the desperate `Nant` defence with pace and guile and was round under the `Nant` posts for the opening try.

The HUFF 50K Trail Notes The HUFF 50K Trail Notes The place for updates on everything related to The HUFF 50K Trail Run. There will be news for veteran runners\, newbies and volunteers. The race is 8 AM\, December 18\, 2010 at J. Edward Roush Lake\, Huntington\, Indiana. Sunday\, March 20\, 2011 New Website - VeepRaces.com The HUFF 50K Trail Run is moving to a new website - VeepRaces.com . Now you can find all our races in one place\, including the Father's Day Run 4 Trails (June 19th) and the Waterfall 5K Trail Run at the Kokiwanee Nature Preserve (June 26th). Nothing has changed in management of The HUFF from when it was first started - Veep Races is just the umbrella under which we direct several races. The HUFF 50K Trail Notes will still be active but it will serve as an adjunct to the main site. At VeepRaces.com you will find registration\, trail maps\, directions\, volunteer sign-up and the most requested item - recipes for the homemade soups provided to HUFF runners at the end of the race. The 2011 HUFF 50K Trail Run will be held on Saturday\, December 17th and ... it will be in a new location which will soon be announced. If all current plans hold the new location will feature slightly more technical trails and will not have anything resembling the windy traverse across the dam on the west edge and the bridge on the east end of the old course. We appreciate the home we had at Huntington for 14 years but changes in financing at the DNR have meant that trailrunners\, mountain bikers and others will no longer have access to the property. Some have asked whether the name of the event will change because long-time HUFF veterans know that the name was an alliteration of Huntington Ultra Frigid Fifty. The answer is: "No\, the name will not change". It will now have the official name of "The HUFF 50 K." Those who would still like to observe an alliteration can think of it standing for "Hoosier Ultra Frigid Fifty" or even "Harper's Ultra Frigid Fifty". But we think the HUFF name has come to stand on its own as one of the largest ultras in North America and as an event where the "test is against time\, distance ... and Mother Nature". We'll see you in December at the new HUFF course and sooner at VeepRaces.com . # posted by Mitch : 8:27 AM  0 comments Tuesday\, December 28\, 2010 2010 HUFF 50K Photos are Posted More than 1180 photographs of the 2010 HUFF 50K Trail Run are now posted by clicking here . The photos were taken by professional photographer Tim Perroud of Perroud Images. You may order prints at the website. # posted by Mitch : 10:00 AM  0 comments Thursday\, December 23\, 2010 Fun Video of HUFF 2010 by the Robillard Crew Jason Robillard put together a fun video of the 2010 HUFF 50K Trail Run race experience of the Hobby Jogga group. You can view it on YouTube by clicking here . You can view the post in which it was embedded at Barefoot Running University by clicking here . # posted by Mitch : 3:23 PM  0 comments Sunday\, December 19\, 2010 Testimonials Posted by Chris Beck on Indiana Trail Running : Yesterday's HUFF was an absolutely great race day. I'll reiterate the big THANK YOU to all of the volunteers and organizers. The starting line was c-o-l-d\, but it didn't take too long to get warmed up (although Barry's blue frostbite fingers tell a different story). The trail was in great shape with the cold weather - no water or slop anywhere. After the first 20 minutes\, the traffic was easily manageable despite the large field in attendance. The aid stations were h-e-a-v-e-n\, thinking especially of the hot\, delicious chicken noodle soup at mile 8 - yum! (In fact\, I may still have a frozen turtle in my pocket from the aid station at mile 4.) The soup selection at the finish was a life saver - the hot and spicy corn chowder by far my favorite. I got to see many old friends\, running with a training partner that I never got to train with\, and met a few new ones\, including a nice Yeti on the run. What a great way to end a year of running!! # posted by Mitch : 8:47 PM  0 comments The Heaviest Trophy 2010 HUFF Overall Men's Winner Brandon Welti with Race Director Mitch Harper holding the heaviest trophy in ultramarathoning.

Photographs will be up soon. # posted by Mitch : 10:11 AM  0 comments Thursday\, December 16\, 2010 The HUFF Course Map The HUFF 50K Course Map remains unchanged from last year. A particular thanks to Jerry Diehl and Bob Berger for laying out\, measuring and marking the course. Jerry and Bob have placed large mile marker signs along with directional arrow signs\, flourescent colored ribbons and other trail marking signs on the HUFF course for race day. # posted by Mitch : 6:18 PM  0 comments Packet Pick Up at the Pasta Dinner or on Race Morning $8.00 for the pre-race pasta dinner. The dinner will be held from 5:45 to 8:15 p.m. the evening before the race at St. Peter Lutheran Church Schoo l at 604 Polk Street (the Church is at 648 North LaFontaine Street) in Huntington. The pasta dinner is provided by the St. Peter Youth Group and proceeds of the pasta dinner benefit the youth activities. Packet pick-up at the St. Peter Lutheran Church School at 604 Polk Street (the Church is at 648 North LaFontaine Street) in Huntington the night before the race or by 7:40 AM at the race site on race day. You can view a map of the race site here on Google Maps. The entrance to the Kil-So-Quah campground is to the left of the arrow. Note: Markle Road is US 224. # posted by Mitch : 6:10 PM  0 comments Kil-So-Quah Parking and Start/Finish Layout You will know you have reached the right place for The HUFF 50K Trail Run when you see this entrance sign on US 224 (Markle Road): It will be a little bit darker when you are trying to discover the large sign on the morning of the race. Once you turn in on the access road next to the sign you will come to the entry gate. The DNR will NOT be collecting a entrance fee this year. There may still be some lines going into the campground but they will simply be from the record turnout this year. Once you get past the gatehouse go STRAIGHT and make the short distance to the campground. Do not turn to the right. Once you near the campground you should see one of the members of the HUFF parking brigade who can help get you parked efficiently. Each campsite shown below can accomodate 2 or 3 vehicles if the first vehicle pulls all the way into the space. 50K runners should try to pull in first. One-loopers should pull in after the 50 folks. Try to coordinate with other runners that you know to make parking as efficient as possible. (There are a few additional campsites that are new not shown on the map.) The map of the campground\, which you can enlarge by clicking\, show the approximate locations of the state\, the main tent\, the chute/relay transition area and path of the course through the campground. The start will take place on the main road. The 50K and first relay runner of a team will start at 8:00 AM. NOTE: THE ONE LOOP RUNNERS WILL START 10 to 15 minutes after the 50K and relay runners start. This is in order to spread out the start\, lessen the initial crowding on the trail and make for a more enjoyable - and faster - trail experience. One loop runners SHOULD NOT try to gain an advantage by starting with the first wave. 50K runners and subsequent relay runners will not run on the road on the 2nd and 3rd loops or legs. You will exit the transition area\, hit the aid table if you need to\, then run west through the short grassy area west of the main tent until you enter the trail. This means the first loop or leg is slightly shorter than the 2nd and 3rd loops. 50K runners will pass through the campground as they finish each loop. This means that if you want to change shoes and socks\, get drier clothing or pick up other supplies from your car\, you can do so. This generally obviates the need for drop bags at one of the two other aid stations. The other aid stations are located approximately 3.5 to 4 miles from each other and from the start/finish. Aid Station "A" is located at the entrance to the Little Turtle State Recreation Area just off Highway 5 (Warren Road) south of the dam. This is at the 4 Mile mark of the loop. This is near the main office for the reservoir. Aid Station "B" is located on Division Road where the trail crosses the road. This is past the shooting range. Note that Division Road ends in a cul-de-sac about a 1/4 mile past Aid Station "B." You can turn around there or you can greet your runner at that cul-de-sac as they emerge from the trail and then go down the trail east of the cul-de-sac as they head to Simpson Road and the bridge on the east side of the course. Division Road is reached by exiting Aid Station "B" and turning left (south) on Highway 5. Go to the first county road south of the Little Turtle entrance and turn left (east) onto Division Road. Since the opening of the shooting range in 2005\, we have had to modify the course and divert runners onto part of Division Road in order to get them past the shooting range. Please be careful as you drive on Division Road in order to provide the HUFF participants with the greatest measure of safety. There will be a portable toilets at Aid Station "A" and at Aid Station "B'." There are additional pit toilets just beyond Aid Station "A" in the campground. (These are visible from the trail). There are three sets of men's and women's modern and upgraded pit toilets at Kil-So-Campground. One set is at the east end where runners finishing the loop will be coming into the campground. Another set is on the west end near the access road. The main set is directly across (south) of the main tent and chute area. We have contracted to put another portable toilet in at that location to augment the two already there. Aid Stations will have water\, sport drink\, defizzed cola and an array of solid foods such as fruit\, pretzels\, chips\, cookies\, M & M's\, hard candy and the like. The aid stations will also have some things special to the aid station such as chocolate turtles at Aid Staion "A\," or boiled potatos\, chicken noodle soup and other goodies. The main tent will\, of course\, have an amazing array of home-made soups and other goodies. More about that later. The HUFF is known for its food! # posted by Mitch : 6:03 PM  0 comments Monday\, November 15\, 2010 Change: T-Shirt included with One Loop Registration This year\, all HUFF participants have a HUFF branded t-shirt included in their registration fee. Since the One Loop run was started\, the t-shirt has been optional for One Loop runners so as to keep the entry fee at a minimal level. This was done to encourage new runners to get introduced to trail running. Well\, trail running is now mainstream. And this change will help our volunteers serve runners more effectively and efficiently at packet pick-up and on race morning. Not all printed forms note the change this year so please let other One Loopers know that the t-shirt is included in the entry fee. # posted by Mitch : 7:30 AM  0 comments Friday\, October 08\, 2010 This Year's Medal Subject has been Chosen The HUFF 50K Medal subject has now been chosen. Each year\, a different historic Miami Native American is featured on the reverse side of the Finisher's Medal for The HUFF 50K Trail Run and HUFF 50K Relay. An 1880's engraving of Miam Chief Little Turtle is on the front. Past honorees have included Kil-So-Quah\, Chief Coesse\, and Chief Jean Baptiste de Richardville. Race registrants will find out first who has been chosen. # posted by Mitch : 12:37 PM  0 comments Sunday\, September 26\, 2010 Printable Entry Form Now Available Participants can choose to register online for The HUFF 50K Trail Run 2010 at SignMeUp.com or by printing and mailing a registration form.

Courses have been locked in and Costa Plenti Estate accommodation booked for 2015's first major tournament. Wyong and Kooindah Waters will host the teams days on Monday and Tuesday with Gosford and Shelly Beach the venues for the individual events on Thursday and Friday. In a tournament first\, carts will be provided for competitors at each course. The Costa Plenti Estate accommodation is exactly the same as last year\, a three bedroom penthouse and 2 two bedroom units at Riveria Apartments. Tenants should settle their accommodation bill by the end of April via payment to President Love's Cayman Island account. Playing numbers haven't changed since January with an expected field of 23 competitors - a tournament record - with two or three others still in the mix. PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES DATE FOR 2015 WORLD SERIES Yamba\, December 11\, 2014.  President Love III has announced World Series XXVII will commence on Monday\, May 18th. Shelly Beach has been booked for Friday's Championship Round and an itinerary for the other days will be put together over the coming weeks. Costs are expected to be in line with 2014 - $400 for golf and a further $350 for those staying on the Costa Plenti Estate. Love said\, "We'll be looking to lock-in the usual high quality accommodation from early February and prospective tenants will need to part with a non-refundable $100 deposit at that time." Soldier Montgomerie is an early scratching after an unbroken quarter century run of WS events (he'll be overseas redesigning the St.Andrews Old Course) but hopefully Muzzy Zoeller's full-time debut and the return of past champions JPY Hayes and Jose-Mumma Olazabal will go a long way towards breaking the record tournament field of 22. PRESIDENT RELEASES AUDITED POST MATCH PLAY ACCOUNTS Yamba\, December 11\, 2014.  President Love III has released our latest audited post-tournament accounts. Balance Pre Match Play - $3889.50 Match Play Revenue - $1750 (25 players x 70) Match Play Expenses - $1925 (green fees 756\, refreshments 309\, prizemoney 750\, trophies 110) Match Play Loss - $175 Balance Post Match Play - $3714.50 I am proud to advise that fees were down\, prizemoney was up and we're drinking Crownies! These substantial improvements were predominantly the outcome of my sound fiscal control and treasury management. Eat your heart out Joe Hockey! Davidson Love III Club President & Auditor BOO BOO WEEKLEY 2014 MATCH PLAY CHAMPION Marrickville\, November 30\, 2014.  Boo Boo Weekley defeated Sir Dick Faldo 4 & 3 in today's Championship Match. The much loved Como Homo(sapien) withstood a blistering start by the 2000 champion who opened a 3 hole lead early on. The turning point probably came at the 7th when Sir Dick\, under the pump on the hole\, sunk a monster putt to place the pressure back on Boo Boo. He responded with a sensational long range putt to square the hole and stopped Dick getting back on a roll. It was also at this point\, a number of Boo Boo's motley and youthful supporters sought refuge at the 19th hole and he was able to shake the incessant advice he was being overfed by a collection of non-qualifiers. Like the fabled Cooks River\, when the tide turns in a match\, it turns quickly. From 3 down early\, Boo Boo had a 3 hole lead when they stepped onto the 15th tee. His 5-iron finished a match-ending foot from the hole. Dick went through the motions for a par before Boo Boo sunk his birdie putt to become the 20th individual match play champion in 26 events. JPY Hayes\, who missed last year's event after a neighbourhood spat with Jose-Mumma Olazabal over whose turn it was to bring the iron and ironing board\, claimed his 3rd major in a rain shortened tournament. JPY held a one point lead over the in-form Kenny Crenshaw after the Day 3 stableford round and maintained that to win the title after Friday's stroke round at Shelly Beach was cancelled due to heavy rain. Kenny Crenshaw's second placing was a continuation of his good form over the past 7 years during which he has not finished worse than 6th. Rounding out the top 3 was Hunter Meehan whose week was sunk when he teamed up with club anchor\, Jose-Mumma Olazabal\, at Kooindah Waters. In Wednesday's World Series of Euchre final\, spectators voted with their feet when Nurse Ratched (aka Tubby Waldorf) paired up with the Cardiac Kid (aka Java Haas) playing against Sir Dick Faldo and his chaperone\, Blue Sheedy. The event\, described by one astute commentator as having all the appeal of a Manly-Bulldogs Grand Final\, was won by Waldorf and Haas 2-0.

The Chairman\, Stuart Bonser commented\, "Miles joins Ashby Ivanhoe FC with a vast amount of experience both as a player and as a Manager and his appointment will bring a renewed excitement to the club\, I have played football at a high level with Miles and also worked with him before and I know he will bring valuable experience and professionalism to the club and I am delighted he has decided to join Ashby Ivanhoe FC". Miles\, who alsolives in Ashby\, added " Behind the scenes the club has made rapid progress which is testament to the hard work and commitment of Stuart and his backroom team. The aim is to produce a team and brand of football on the pitch that matches that off field dedication to the cause. Watch this space! " IVANHOE COMMUNITY SHIELD 2015 On Sunday 31st May the Ivanhoe Community Shield 2015 will take place at the NFU Sports Ground. In partnership with Santander Ashby there will be 16 five a side teams from local business and organisations battling to become the inaugural champions. Also during the day there will be a charity auction\, sit-down bingo\, BBQ and bar. All proceeds will go the Rainbows Trust and the festival of football begins at 12noon. VANDALISM THREATENS JUNIOR SESSIONS On April the 14 th the club fell victim to an act of mindless vandalism. Vital grounds maintenanceequipment was ransacked including a ride on lawn mower leaving us with no way of maintaining the pitches. Luckily this took place close to the end of our footballing season so no games were affected. However the club isnt dormant in the close season. Junior training sessions and school holiday courses still take place. With no means of maintaining the pitches these sessions and courses could well be under threat. The junior teams are the future of our football club and holiday courses are a great source of income\, if we cannot run these sessions the club will be greatly effected in its progress on and off the field.

She began to play golf at the age of six as the result of trips to a local driving range with her father. By the time Judy was seven she had stunned St. Louis golfing circles by winning a city wide closest to the pin contest over a large field of adult men and women. Her effort grabbed a headline in the next days St. Louis Post Dispatch newspaper that read\, "SEVEN YEAR OLD WINS HOLE IN ONE CONTEST" At the age of eight she won the twelve year old division of the National Pee Wee Championship. She would go on to win this event three more times. Following this\, tournament officials renamed the winners trophy "The Judy Torluemke Trophy." In 1959 at the age of fourteen Judy once again stunned her peers by winning the Missouri State Amateur. Some forty-five years later she remains the events youngest winner. She would lose in the semi finals in 1960\, but regained the title in 1961. She became the youngest ever low amateur in a U.S. Open in 1960 at the age of fifteen\, that years open was played at Baltusrol Country Club in New Jersey. Judy Torluemke became a Sports Illustrated cover girl in August of 1961. After joining the LPGA tour in 1962 her game showed potential but little else. Her play began to pick up in 1964 as she was named the tours "Most Improved Player." She cracked the top ten money winners in 1965\, and again in 1966. In 1967 the 22 year old Torluemke wed Walter Rankin of Midland\, Texas. She gave birth to her son Walter "Tuey" Rankin in 1968. After rejoining the tour in late 68 she promptly won her first LPGA tournament\, the Corpus Christi Civitan Open. Rankin enjoyed a respectable but winless season in 1969 finishing second three times. Judy Rankin took her place among the elite of womens golf in 1970 when she won three tournaments and ended the year fifth on the tour money list. She suffered through a season long slump in 1971 that didn't end until the years final event in Waco\, Texas\, when she defeated Jane Blalock in a sudden death playoff for her fifth career victory. She began to receive national attention in 1972 when she led the inaugural Dinah Shore Championship for most of the way until faltering on the back nine during the final round. She went on to win two events in 72\, and finished the year the tours number three money winner. 1973 would be Rankin's best year yet as she captured four tournaments and finished second on the money list. She won the first of three Vare Trophies for lowest stroke average over the entire season. Golf Magazine\, named her "Player of The Year." Her performance fell off a bit in 1974 even though she managed to capture two tournaments including the Colgate European Open. 1975 would be a year of success qualified by frustration as she played her way into three sudden death playoffs inside a four week period only to lose all three. She did capture the National Jewish Hospital Open in Denver\, Co\, and finished fifth on the money list. Rankin made her a permanent mark on womens golf in 1976 when she became the first woman golfer to win one hundred thousand dollars in a single season. Her year began on a high note as she won the first event of the season in Miami\, Florida. Then in April\, she captured the one that got away in 1972\, the Colgate Dinah Shore. She came from three strokes off the pace the final day by shooting an amazing 68 in brutal cold and gusting winds. ABC announcer Bob Rosberg commented during the telecast "considering these conditions this may be one of the greatest rounds ever played." She would win four more times that season. Rankin won one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in 1976\, shattering the previous record by more than sixty thousand dollars. She captured her second career Vare Trophy\, and her first LPGA Player of the Year Award. During her pursuit of the hundred thousand dollar mark she received unprecedented media attention for a woman golfer. 1977 brought more of the same from Rankin\, she would go on to win five events\, the Vare Trophy\, and the Player of the Year Award. Among her wins in 77 were the du Maurier\, and her second Colgate European Open title. That year also saw her become the first female golfer to be placed on the cover of Golf Magazine. The end of the 1977 season would mark the end of Judy's five year reign as the best woman golfer in the world. From 1973 through 1977 she won more tournaments 17\, more money $442\,669\, and had the lowest stroke average 72.89 on the LPGA tour. The 1978 season would mark the start of Rankin's decline as a tour superstar. Chronic back problems that began to haunt her in 1974 became worse. She would win just fifty thousand dollars and take just one event. She appeared to be regaining her form in 1979 as she ended the year eighth on the money list. She captured her final LPGA victory at the WUI Classic. Her play in the 80's was only a shadow of her former self as burnout\, back pain\, and a new crop of young and hungry competitors took their toll. One of the great misnomers about Judy's career is the belief that she "never" won a major championship. Over the years the LPGA has designated a number of tournaments as "majors." The only two that have consistently held this label are the U.S. Open\, and the LPGA Championship. For much of the career of Rankin\, and other top players of this era\, there were only two "majors" in a season. By 1976\, the Dinah Shore Championship\, and the U.S. Open\, were the most coveted crowns in women's golf. When Judy Rankin won the Dinah Shore\, it was not considered a major. In fact\, the event was not given "major" status until 1979. Many consider this a travesty. Judy Rankin also won the 1977 du Maurier championship\, which later became a "major." She also won two Colgate European Open's\, which was the forerunner of the Women's British Open. Asside from the fact that she became known for her outstanding play on the course\, Judy Rankin became unique in her sport for another reason. Her strong left hand grip on the club was ridiculed by golf experts when she first came upon the scene. Many felt she would never succeed as a professional with what they labeled the "worst left hand grip in golf." Years later\, players adopting the strong left hand became commonplace. Paul Azinger\, John Daly\, Fred Couples\, Beth Daniel\, Nancy Lopez\, and many others have used variations on what NBC's Johnny Miller\, has called "The Judy Rankin grip." After three years of semi retirement\, Judy Rankin began to appear as a guest commentator on ABC\, and ESPN's\, golf telecasts in 1985. This role quickly became a second career\, as she became a regular on LPGA\, PGA\, and Champions Tour events. She has been heard on golf broadcasts all over the world\, and has been on the scene for some of the sports greatest moments. In 1996 she was given in her words "The biggest honor of my professional career\," when she was named the United States Captain\, of the LPGA's Solhiem Cup team. Like the Ryder Cup for the men\, this is a competition between the best of the American tour\, against the best of Europe. Judy's 96 squad defeated the Euro's thanks to total dominance in the final day's singles matches. She was once again named captain in 1998 when the matches returned to the U.S. Her 1998 squad held off a fierce rally from the European's on the final day to retain the cup. Judy Rankin was finally elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2000. She was inducted along side of LPGA greats Juli Inkster\, and Beth Daniel.

Fundraising and organizing is ongoing through the "Skate Board" an advisory board to the Parks and Recreation Department. This spring and summer the site will be landscaped and an art/painting project will be organized.  The "Skate Board" The "Skate Board" is the board running the skate park. Its primary responsibility is to channel skaters ideas to Parks and Recreation on such matters as facility rules\, facility management and enforcement\, scheduling special events\, conduct\, equipment selection\, fee structure\, fund raising\, and park improvements.

The Lucha Libre homepage with all kinds of information on Mexcian wrestling. Here are the things you can find on this page: 1. A brief introduction to the Mexican Lucha style. 2. A dictionary of moves and other stuff. 3. The only PPV Mexican promotions ever had (for as far as I know): When Worlds Collide . 4. Art Barr as the Gringo Loco. 5.

Welcome to Toma's Fast Fords! And Other Fun Toys This page is dedicated to my love for quick "street cars" on a budget. Some of you Ford guys will notice my '86 Dodge Omni GLH Turbo. Before you snicker\, consider I had less then $1500 into the car\, and it runs 13.8's! On this site\, you will find info on my past and present rides\, info on turbos\, superchargers\, Mustang 460 big block swaps\, some info on tuning etc. Current Projects: Pump Gas 383w Turbo Past Projects: Stock Block 5.0 1986 GLH-T Omni 1988 460 Mustang LX 1989 Incon Twin Turbo LX 1989 Powerdyne Supercharged Coupe (470rwhp) Friends Cars: Information: Help and Advice Turbo vs Supercharger 302 Engine Theory Cool Stuff: Videos My Business: DynoMotive Chassis Dyno Services Email        Updates: WAAAYY overdue for an Update! The Pump Gas 383w cranked an amazing 9.26@151mph in Edmonton. Tuned A9L computer\, about 16 psi. I am VERY happy. If it had a boost controller\, it could go faster\, but that is the best I could do without spinning the tires ;). Derek P in his AWESOME 2007 Shelby GT500 went down to Las Vegas for the Street Car Supernationals V\, and first time on Drag Radial ran an EASY 7.42@200 mph! Here is Derek P. lined up against Pro Sock Legend Bob Glidden at the Supernationals IV in 2008 when he ran Outlaw 10.5. Background: I love "sleepers". I love cars built on a budget. I love cars built by their owners. I like to push stock parts to the limit\, and love to see just how far you can go with them. My 460 Mustang ran high 9's and turned 7000 rpm on a stock bottom end. The Incon turbo Mustang made 611rwhp on a stock 5.0 HO shortblock. The GLH Turbo omni runs 13.8's on a high mile T2 motor\, stock everything except more boost\, 3" exhaust\, "chip"\, and K&N filter. The supercharged coupe ran 11's on stock intake\, injectors\, mass air and throttle body. Not bad considering I live and race at 3500 feet above sea level. Back in early 2001\, I was lucky enough to acquire my own chassis dynamometer. It was a state of the art Mustang MD250 which was capable performing some very usefull tests\, had a full computer controlled eddy current absorber\, and had been a fantastic tool for tuning and diagnostics. Last year\, I sold the old Girl to "The Mustang Shop"\, and purchased a new DynoDynamics MD250 Chassis Dyno. I've had as much as 1480 rwhp on it\, it's a great compact little dyno!. I LOVE imports. We are at the doorstep of a performance revolution\, where a streetable\, drivable\, 4 cylinder grocery getter can take down "Goliath" V8's and big blocks. In the video section I added the video of my Omni taking down a 2003 Viper at the race track.... it was a blast\, and the crowd LOVED it ;~) While at the Vegas Supernationals V\, top qualifier in "Limited Street" was a Toyota Supra! I still love V8's\, but they better be able to hold their own without robbing the bank. Tuning EFI systems is a hobby that turned into a part time business\, and I have done a ton of BS3\, FAST\, Tech 3\, AEM and Accel tunes\, Inlcuding Paul S. and Derek P's competitive PSCA/SCSN Drag Radial cars...... check out my other site... www.dynomotive.ca \, though I am currently closed for the season. I often travel to the US to tune for guys at races\, other cities around home\, and will be heading to South America to tune some radical imports in the next year. Should be fun! So\, feel free to look around\, browse\, and come back once in a while and check for updates.  => /Top/Sports/Basketball/Women/College_And_University/Ncaa_Division_I/Big_Ten_Conference/Iowa

HOME                        Aikido is a Japanese martial art. Today's aikido has splintered into a multitude of styles ranging from those which are extremely philosophical\, practicing soft\, dance-like movements to those which are more physical\, emphasizing the more realistic martial effectiveness of the art. Aikido of Jacksonville was founded in 2000\, and teaches aikido in a manner that focuses on realistic self-defense techniques. Aikido is a unique martial art for self-defense for many reasons including the fact that a majority of the empty hand techniques in its' curriculum can translate easily into a defense against a weapon such as a knife or stick.

Crooklyn Baseball <$BlogRSDUrl$> Crooklyn Baseball Baseball fan has his say. Sunday\, March 12\, 2006 Book wreaks havoc on Bonds The March 13 edition of Sports Illustrated dropped some bombs after printing excerpts from an upcoming book\, "Game of Shadows" by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams. It documents the jealosy Bonds felt as McGwire and Sosa were in the middle of the homerun chase and how he decided to do whatever it took to get a piece of that action. The book alleges that Barry went on a workout and steroid binge that saw him take pharmaceuticals like Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol. It also looks at his involvement with BALCO and their designer steroids that could not be detected through conventional testing. # posted by Crooklyn @ 5:24 PM Tuesday\, March 07\, 2006 Kirby Puckett passes away Hall of Fame baseball player and Twins fan favorite Kirby Puckett died today after suffering a brain aneurysm. Puckett was best known as the Minnesota Twins centre fielder and won two World Series (1987\, 1991) with the team. He had to retire in 1996 after suffering from glaucoma in one eye. Puckett was fighting weight problem and had recently gotten through some personal problems in his post-baseball career. Kirby Puckett spent all 12 of his major league seasons with the Minnesota Twins\, hitting .318 with 207 home runs and 1\,085 runs batted in from 1984 through 1995. He will be greatly missed by all baseball fans. # posted by Crooklyn @ 6:45 PM Saturday\, March 04\, 2006 2006 season is just around the corner Even as much of North America is under a cold spell\, Florida and Arizona are teeming with baseball players\, coaches and fans. Spring training has started so it won't be very long before we have ourselves some better weather and baseball games. The off season has been tumultous with the Toronto Blue Jays making a real push for the American League East this year. On a sadder note\, it seems like Sammy Sosa's career has probably ended as he has yet to sign with anyone. And don't forget\, this year also brings the first ever "World Baseball Classic" that will pit the best baseball playing countries around the world\, against each other over the next couple of weeks. # posted by Crooklyn @ 4:46 PM Saturday\, November 19\, 2005 MLB implements tough new steroid penalties After getting whacked around by the US Congress and many observers\, Major League Baseball and its players union have agreed to implement a new steroid policy that seems to have some teeth. Proposed earlier this year by Bud Selig\, the new agreement includes the following penalties: - 50 games for first offense - 100 games for the second offense - Lifetime ban for the third offense (can be appealed after 2 years) MLB has also added some penalties for players detected of useing amphetamines. First positive test will require mandatory additional testing\, second offense will yield a 25-game suspension and a third offense will see the player suspended for 80-game suspension. # posted by Crooklyn @ 2:06 PM Friday\, October 28\, 2005 White Sox win World Series The Chicago White Sox defeated the Houston Astros in four straight games to win the 2005 World Series of baseball. The White Sox were a dominating team throughout the season and even though they stumbled a little in August\, like many great teams they bounced right back and blew through the playoffs. This is the team's first World Series victory since the infamous "Black Sox" scandal from 1917. Now if only their cross town rivals the Chicago Cubs could win the big dance and end their even longer drought. # posted by Crooklyn @ 7:29 PM Friday\, September 23\, 2005 Orioles to Palmeiro: Stay at home The Rafael Palmeiro steroids saga seems to have taken a recent turn for the worst. Recent reports indicate that Palmeiro testified in his grievance hearing that he may have tested positive after receiving vitamins from teammate Miguel Tejada. Palmeiro spoke of receiving a shot of vitamin B-12 but Tejada has come out denying he gave Raffy any vitamins. This may have broken the horse's back as the Orioles seem to have had enough. In an effort to put an end to the distraction this saga has caused for the struggling team\, they have asked Palmeiro to stay at home for the rest of this season. It is more than likely that Rafael Palmeiro may have played his last Major League Baseball game. # posted by Crooklyn @ 6:08 PM Monday\, August 01\, 2005 Palmeiro tests positive for 'roids It was about six month ago when Rafael Palmeiro sat in front of Congress and unequivocally denies the allegations put forth by former Rangers teammate Jose Canseco on the use of performance enhancing drugs. Fast forward to more recent times as Palmeiro crossed the 3\,000 hit plateau this season and then to today\, when he was suspended for testing positive for anabolic steroids. The 40-year-old Palmeiro became the seventh player to fail a test under the toughened major league policy that took effect in March\, rules criticized by Congress as not being stringent enough. Without giving specifics\, the four-time All-Star left the impression that the banned substance was contained in a supplement that was not prescribed. Either way\, this could keep him out of the Cooperstown and it surely makes Rafael Palmeiro look like a real a$$. Since this is his first offence\, he will be suspended for 10 games. # posted by Crooklyn @ 7:54 PM Baseball Fanatics Baseball Crank Armchair GM Hockey Fans Hockey Fights Nascar Portal Archives 02/15/2004 - 02/22/2004 02/22/2004 - 02/29/2004 02/29/2004 - 03/07/2004 03/07/2004 - 03/14/2004 03/14/2004 - 03/21/2004 03/21/2004 - 03/28/2004 03/28/2004 - 04/04/2004 04/04/2004 - 04/11/2004 04/11/2004 - 04/18/2004 04/18/2004 - 04/25/2004 04/25/2004 - 05/02/2004 05/02/2004 - 05/09/2004 05/09/2004 - 05/16/2004 05/16/2004 - 05/23/2004 05/23/2004 - 05/30/2004 05/30/2004 - 06/06/2004 06/06/2004 - 06/13/2004 06/13/2004 - 06/20/2004 06/20/2004 - 06/27/2004 06/27/2004 - 07/04/2004 07/04/2004 - 07/11/2004 07/11/2004 - 07/18/2004 07/18/2004 - 07/25/2004 07/25/2004 - 08/01/2004 08/08/2004 - 08/15/2004 08/15/2004 - 08/22/2004 08/22/2004 - 08/29/2004 08/29/2004 - 09/05/2004 09/05/2004 - 09/12/2004 09/12/2004 - 09/19/2004 09/26/2004 - 10/03/2004 10/03/2004 - 10/10/2004 10/10/2004 - 10/17/2004 10/17/2004 - 10/24/2004 10/24/2004 - 10/31/2004 10/31/2004 - 11/07/2004 11/21/2004 - 11/28/2004 11/28/2004 - 12/05/2004 12/12/2004 - 12/19/2004 01/02/2005 - 01/09/2005 01/09/2005 - 01/16/2005 01/16/2005 - 01/23/2005 01/23/2005 - 01/30/2005 01/30/2005 - 02/06/2005 02/06/2005 - 02/13/2005 03/13/2005 - 03/20/2005 04/03/2005 - 04/10/2005 05/01/2005 - 05/08/2005 06/12/2005 - 06/19/2005 06/26/2005 - 07/03/2005 07/10/2005 - 07/17/2005 07/31/2005 - 08/07/2005 09/18/2005 - 09/25/2005 10/23/2005 - 10/30/2005 11/13/2005 - 11/20/2005 02/26/2006 - 03/05/2006 03/05/2006 - 03/12/2006 03/12/2006 - 03/19/2006 => /Top/Sports/Equestrian/Personal_Pages/R

Dear Future Martial Artist\, The very fact that you are reading this tells me a lot about you. It tells me that you want to improve yourself or that you want to have the very best for your child. I would like to help you achieve your PERSONAL goals in the martial arts. I would like to help you get the all of the benefits that martial arts classes have to offer\, for either you or your child. My name is Kevin Kawada and I\, along with my wife Renee\, my daughter Kaitlyn and my son Isaac are the owners of the Las Vegas Kung Fu Academy. We have been teaching martial arts classes since March of 2004 when we moved to Las Vegas from Hawaii. Since that time we have worked very hard to provide the Las Vegas and Henderson\, Nevada areas with the best martial arts instruction and self improvement training possible. When I was a teenager\, I started training in the martial arts. At that time in my life\, I personally wasnt looking for any of the benefits that the martial arts had to offer. I just thought it was the coolest thing in the world to be able to actually learn this stuff. It wasnt until I started started to progress in the martial arts that I became aware of all of the benefits\, that martial arts classes had to offer. The improvement in my life that I gained from learning these life skills\, far exceeded any benefits that the physical skills like kicking and punching ever gave me. Skills like focus and concentration\, confidence\, and self discipline became a huge part of my personality. In other words\, as I went to more and more martial arts classes\, my life began to change. I found that in every aspect of my life I was using the warrior mindset and applying the lessons of martial arts to everyday encounters with people. I found that I began to surround myself with like minded individuals and I began to spend less time with people who were content with being lazy\, undisciplined and irresponsible. I wasnt using any physical technique at all\, (as in fighting) but\, I started to see everyday experiences as lessons I began to approach problems in my life the same way I approached my martial arts classes. I realized that the martial arts like Karate\, Chinese Kung Fu\,and Jujitsu are not just ways of fighting\, but rather they are ways or paths to learning about yourself. I found that the same perseverance that I had to have in order to learn a martial arts form was the same type of perseverance that I needed to write a college paper. I found that mental toughness required for sparring helped me get through stressful times in my life. I took what was taught in class and APPLIED it to life outside of the martial arts school. If the lessons of martial arts cannot improve you as a person\, martial arts instruction really has little value in todays modern society. To me\, martial arts is really a way of life. Training in the martial arts is a never ending quest for improvement. If you can commit yourself to the time and effort it takes to really learn the martial arts\, training can be by far the most wonderful\, life changing\, activity that you could ever hope to do. If you master the skills required of a true martial arts style\, you will in essence have mastered yourself. My life has been transformed by the martial arts and I hope that it can do something similar for you. Sincerely\, Kevin and Renee Kawada Search Recent Pins. Followed by 40 people. ?

Salt River Fields Salt River Fields at Talking Stick has become the premiere Spring Training facility in the Cactus League and is the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies. History While the team may be only a few years old\, the franchise is already building a place in history. From the first moment Arizona began planning for a potential expansion team through the inaugural season to World Series champion there is a lot of events that have occurred. In this secion you will find a chronology of events\, franchise firsts\, commemorative baseballs\, jersey numbers\, and uniforms. Games There is nothing quite like being at the ballpark. The smells of fresh cut grass and grilling hot dogs. The sounds of the crack of the bat or a perfect fastball hitting the catcher's mitt. These are the things that make baseball special. In the history of the Arizona Diamondbacks there have been countless memories made at each game. Here you will find schedules\, game results\, box scores and more to relive each game. Stadiums On November 16\, 1995 ground was broken in Phoenix on what would become Bank One Ballpark. The stadium would be renamed Chase Field in 2005 and remains the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team began Spring Training in 1998 at Tucson Electric Park but moved to Salt River Fields in Scottsdale in 2011. This section includes information on each of the stadiums the Diamondbacks have called home. Players The Arizona Diamondbacks first player was drafted in 1996 two full years before the team would play their first game. From that moment on a countless number of players have arrived in Phoenix and worn the uniform of the local team. In this section you will find rosters from years past\, a current roster\, transactions of player movements\, players who have been All-Stars for the Diamondbacks\, and other interesting facts.  A ballplayer spends a good piece of his life gripping a baseball\, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time. Home Next Game San Francisco Giants VS. Arizona Diamondbacks Chase Field April 6\, 2015 6:40 PM Fan Favorites Chase Field Camera Policy Chase Seating Layout Jersey Records Stadium Review Gameday Timeline Welcome to NowHitting! Now Hitting has been designed as a clearing house of information about the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball club. This site is designed to provide information and news on the Diamondbacks as they begin their quest for a National League Western Division championship. Rather than having to search on multiple web sites to find information about the Diamondbacks\, Now Hitting attempts to gather this data to a central location for your enjoyment. The site is a mixture of current information along with historical data covering the Arizona Diamondbacks Major League Baseball franchise. NowHitting.com represents one fan's love affair with baseball. It began when a Major League Baseball franchise was awarded on March 9\, 1995. The site chronicles the timeline of bringing baseball to the Phoenix area. It is a result of countless hours of research to uncover the details about the team\, its players\, and baseball in general. I invite you to travel along through the history of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The information and graphics are provided to help you become part of the game. Whether you are a Diamondbacks fan or just someone curious of what baseball in the desert is like\, you should find something of interest to you. So I invite you to stop by often and see what's new with this National League West franchise and its fans. NowHitting is a fan operated web site meaning there are fewer boundaries to what can and cannot be published. This results in a more honest and objective viewpoint when compared to more traditional team coverage. NowHitting is an open communication tool and users are invited to state their opinions as they feel appropriate. I will attempt to include various points of view so that the whole story can be told\, not just what was in the press release. So sit back and enjoy NowHitting. I think you'll agree that it represents baseball for the new millennium. Chase Field Camera Policy Chase Field Security is enforcing a policy that limits the size and types of cameras that are allowed into the ballpark. The policy allows still cameras with fixed lenses and those with interchangeable lenses to enter the stadium. Read More Requesting Player Visits Requests for player appearances are handled through the Community Relations department of the Arizona Diamondbacks. For information on the necessary process please see the Arizona Diamondbacks web site for more details. Read More Contacting the Players Fans wanting to contact a player seeking an autograph should mail their item to the Arizona Diamondbacks in care of the player's name. Read More History Stadiums Players Games Connect  About This Site When people come across the site; many of them assume it is managed and maintained by the Arizona Diamondbacks or Major League Baseball Media. That is not the case. It was created out of equal parts of passion and desperation by one fan who at the time had a difficult time finding information about the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team was relatively new and did not yet have a loyal following. Likewise the Internet was just taking off and there were very few sites that provided information about baseball especially the newest franchise.

Better news from the 4th XI\, who can also boast an unbeaten start to the season after an exciting two wicket win at Oxsted and Limpsfield. Over 500 runs were scored in the afternoon  the hosts making first use of the pitch to complilea comanding 253-9 in their 45 overs. David Woods (4-64) and Tim Brown (5-58) both enjoyed success with the ball.

Some are struggling while others are excelling. Changing teams\, changing roles\, and the pressure to perform all have an effect.

MountainHorseSense : Rocky Mountain Horses for Sale Home | About Us | Our Horses | Training | Horses for Sale | Photo Gallery | Contact Us Welcome to Mountain Horse Sense Up against the Continental Divide at 7150 feet\, MountainHorseSense is nestled against a towering red mesa in the high desert country of Quemado\, New Mexico . Here Rocky Mountain and Kentucky Mountain horses come from old bloodlines\, are beautifully gaited\, and have wonderful dispositions. Once you get to know a Mountain Horse\, you won't be happy with any other breed. We know\, because that's what happened to us. Naturally gaited with a singlefoot or rack\, they carry you smoothly all day in the roughest terrain\, their sensible minds and catty balance make traversing mountain ledges safe\, and their fun loving personality makes them truly delightful companions. Gentle\, highly intelligent and very willing\, these comfortable horses have a beauty and presence that turns heads wherever they go. Rockies are perhaps best known for having chocolate colored bodies with flaxen or white manes and tails\, but they come in all solid colors. We have the signature chocolates\, elegant blacks\, classic bays and shiny sorrels. We believe that as beautiful as color may be\, it is the least important characteristic of a horse. We select for a mellow trail horse temperament\, solid gait and good conformation. Our horses are easy keepers both in matters of feed and veterinary care\, have strong tough feet that are a farrier's dream and all have the friendly puppy dog personality that Rockies are famous for. There is no better trail horse of any breed\, and here we are lucky to be able to have our Rocky Mountain Horses in a terrain of mesas\, mountains and rolling high country that suits them so well. This is the countryside of the Anasazi\, of Butch and Sundance\, of Geronimo -- all of whom would doubtless have been delighted to have had a tough\, smooth and elegant Mountain Horse to ease their travels and travails. If you are interested in learning more about the breed \, taking a test drive or are looking for your special buddy\, please give Lisa or Ken a call or send an e-mail. We'd love to hear from you.

World's premiere custom bicycle design studio - we design the custom bike around you\, not fit you to a bike. Home About Us Ebay Online Store KGS Bikes Online Store KGS Bikes Website Subscribe KGS Bikes Custom Bicycles World's premiere custom bicycle design studio - We design the bike around you\, not fit you to a bike Whats new at KGS Custom Bicycles? by kgsbikes on November 30\, 2011 in Bicycle Positioning \, Bikes An example of a KGS Custom Bicycle The market for our premium custom bicycles is a global one\, and is a small niche comprised of people who want the very best and are willing to come to San Antonio to commission a bicycle that takes up to six months or more to receive\, and then be so happy with the result that they think the effort was worth it. We have been working behind the scenes a lot this fall\, with clients who have commissioned bikes in private and find that that is more common than not at this level. From a marketing perspective\, however\, it is hard to brag on ones accomplishments when clients dont want their purchases disclosed! That has been the trend since the Recession and we have learned to simply comply with clients wishes and exceed their expectations\, regardless of the ability of the rest of the world to know or not know who is buying our fantastic machines. So since we have had a string of folks who have chosen to not tell the world that they have cool bikes that you would want too if you knew\, here is a little recap of the state of KGS Bikes and where we are heading. Firstly\, we are moving! The retail location that we got six years ago is now too small and the lease is up. We are taking the opportunity to move to a new location that will be a destination\, not a walk-in location. Since we are in final negotiations with the new landlord\, we would be remiss to say much more for now\, until we have a signed and executed lease. Suffice it to say\, the destination will be better for a personal bicycle commissioning experience and we will be closer to the San Antonio Airport for easier transport to and from your plane. Second\, we are putting more value features in a KGS Custom Bicycle package. At this level\, the bike is just part of the deal. The experience of commissioning a completely hand crafted masterpiece at this level is becoming more and more rare in the world and we want to improve the experience so every time you ride your custom bicycle you are reminded that you worked hard to get here and you deserve this level of performance and comfort. Third\, we are constantly on the lookout for better frames and components. Since most people come to us and say\, Build me a bike and make it the best\, we are never satisfied with the current state of the art. We want to push our suppliers to make better stuff for our clients and we are on the hunt for the best of the best. It is a never ending search. Here is a PDF Executive Summary of how we do things if you are in the market for a new custom bicycle. It is handy to pass to your friends as well. We want you to be incredibly happy and to outline things as best we can in advance. Have a great holiday shopping season and if you think it is time to discuss a new custom bicycle for yourself or significant other\, lets talk . { 1 comment } Too hot to ride? Commission a Custom Bicycle for the fall! by kgsbikes on August 8\, 2011 in Bicycle Positioning \, Bikes Argeny Hunter just took delivery of this beauty. At KGS Custom Bicycles\, the summer is the slowest time of the year. We dont have a big repair department since most of our clientele hails from afar. Most of our clients or potential clients are vacationing\, busy with kids\, or riding the bike they currently have. What is interesting\, however is the Fall Rally\, as we call it\, or the people who thought it was too hot to ride in the summer\, and by the time school starts\, they ponder a new custom bike. Current lead times are typically about 3 months for a road bike and up to six months for a KGS / Parlee custom triathlon bicycle. Universally\, they discover something else\, however. It is a two word phrase called lead time. For some reason\, most people dont factor in the lead time required to commission a true premium custom bicycle. The lead time is the one feature of buying bicycles at this level that is a real pain. This is why this time of year\, we spend a lot of time introducing our concepts to people and asking them to consider a trip to the studio for a BalancePoint session. We then have the data required to design a bike and can work remotely from this point on. Here is the typical positioning day trip schedule for an individual who flys into San Antonio. Take the first flight into San Antonio. Kevin personally picks you up at the airport and drives you to the studio. You need to bring cycling clothing\, shoes\, and if your pedals or saddle are unusual\, bring them too. At least we will have discussed this to know that when you arrive\, we are ready for you. The actual positioning takes between 1 to 3 hours and so your time in the studio tends to be 2-4 hours. Plan on at least 5 hours before you need to be back at the airport\, at least 60-90 minutes prior to your flight. Kevin will buy your lunch and whisk you back to the airport\, so you have no car rental\, plus no pain dealing with transportation. This works for either road\, triathlon or both positions. If you need to do both (they are separate procedures with separate results) you can have the data to order one bike now and another later\, with one visit. What happens next is we design your bicycle and calculate the price. You send us 75% and we start moving. BTW the last 25% is due when the frame ships back to us\, and we dont charge you for changing your mind on components in the mean time. The reason for this policy is many out of towners dont take delivery of their bike when it is actually finished and we can keep it perfect and safe for you but we are so small that we cant take the cash flow hit to handle delivery delays. Our track record for exceeding expectations is fantastic and we invite you to consider the benefits of true custom designed just for you. You are worth it\, and the lead times can work for you\, not against you. Finally\, here is a link to our Referral Program where we are sinking all of our marketing dollars. Those who help us find a match with new clients get the rewards. { 2 comments } Marfa 100 Charity Ride by kgsbikes on August 7\, 2011 in Bike Rides It is not often we promote a poster as much as a ride\, but when we saw the one of a kind original Marfa 100 ride posters\, we had to share. They were done by hooking up a brush to a stationary bike of some sorts and each of one hundred people rode a kilo to create their poster. While the photo shown is big enough for your monitor\, a print version is here . Here is stuff straight from the Marfa 100 website: The 2011 ride will start and finish at the Capri building\, at the Thunderbird Hotel in Marfa. From here\, the course will take riders 31 miles out beautiful FM2810 and return on the same path. The average temp for Marfa at this time is a high of 84 and low of 55 degrees. We had beautiful weather last year and were hoping for the same this year. Please note this is a rain or shine event. Registrants can pick up ride packets on Friday\, September 0\, at Marfa Public Radio\, 111 S Highland Ave in Marfa\, just north of the main four-way stop. Last minute entries can be made in person on Sept 9 or the morning of the 10th. The $100 entry fee includes a $75 tax deductible receipt\, a Marfa 100 T-shirt and a gathering at Padres the night of Sept 10. Feel free to post questions via our Facebook and Twitter pages.

Charlie Brockus is in the 60-64 age group and is shown here on his way to winning his age group at the Rohto Ironman70.3 Hawaii triathlon . This gets Charlie his ticket to Kona\, the Ford Ironman World Championships . Charlie has been dealing with a foot injury that hampered his running\, but his KGS / Parlee custom triathlon bike has been helping him tremendously. He has been beating folks much younger and I bet that is extremely gratifying. While Charlie lives in Reno\, he flew down to the KGS Bikes studio and we found his position with our BalancePoint system\, and sent him on his way home\, since we can work totally remotely from this point on. The bike frame was commissioned from Parlee Cycles\, built here at KGS Bikes and then shipped to Charlie in a TriAll3 case. We wish Charlie a super season and expect a podium finish at Kona. { 0 comments } KGS Bikes Custom Bicycles to exhibit in Abu Dhabi UAE in 2012 20 June 2011 KGS Bikes Custom Bicycles is a global business.

Adios\, JP" posted by Steve Corcoran at 6:31 PM | 4 comments Wednesday\, February 08\, 2006 Summit 411 Newsletter "Please help obtain Forest Service approval for planned improvements at The Summit...February 6\, 2006 The Summit at Snoqualmie is proposing improvements designed to significantly enhance your future experience at the resort. But before a plan can be finalized\, approval is needed from the U.S. Forest Service.Public comments are an important factor as the Forest Service makes its decision. We hope people who know and love The Summit will take a moment to learn more about the proposed improvements and submit a comment to the Forest Service. It's easy to do and it WILL make a difference. Click and comment today\, before the February 21st deadline!You can e-mail your comments: Deadline for comments is February 21\, so there's not much time. Scroll down to find out more about what's planned and how to comment\, then click the link to go to the U.S. Forest Service website! Doing it right-a balanced plan for The SummitWe know you want to enjoy the stunning Cascade mountain environment - but do so in good conscience\, knowing that extra care was taken to balance great recreation with protection of the environment. It has taken 8 years of planning and environmental studies to develop the improvement plan. Planned benefits:More time skiing\, less time in line\, by providing services more strategically throughout the resort\, including on-mountain.Improved and enhanced terrain\, including more intermediate runs.Greater separation between skiers and boarders of differing skill levels.Better designed connecting trails and lifts that allow you to circulate to different areas of the resort without having to take a shuttle.Improved services\, more restaurants.A pulse gondola to the top of Alpental with a restaurant that's open winter and summer.New Alpental chairlifts that provide more convenient access to Internationale Bowl. Protecting the environment:We want to respond to our customers' needs\, but do so with minimal environmental consequences. Here are parameters we set for ourselves:Stay within the permit area - 98% of all proposed improvements are within the existing permit area for the resort.Protect the forest - We're adding chairlifts and creating new trails\, so some trees\, including some that are mature\, second-growth\, must be removed. But we're removing as few as possible\, taking only trees that are closest to existing ski runs\, minimizing grading\, and providing a buffer of mature trees to a potential wildlife corridor.Protect wildlife - Wildlife populations and movement were carefully studied and the improvements minimize impacts to wildlife.Inclusive review process - Underway for more than eight years\, the review process has been thorough and inclusive. Send your comments to the Forest ServicePlease take a moment to review a summary of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement\, or the entire document online at www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/projects/ and contact the U.S. Forest Service in support of The Summit at Snoqualmie's proposed improvements before February 21. E-mail your comments to the Forest Service here . Only comments that are substantive and address proposed improvements outlined in the report will be considered by the Forest Service. Comments like "Looks good\, build it!" will not be considered. Tips on writing effective comments:State your opinion about a proposed resort improvement.Back up your opinion with your personal experience.Focus on problems you experience and how proposed improvements will solve your problems.Example: "I am an intermediate skier and there isn't enough intermediate terrain at The Summit. The proposal to add intermediate and advanced intermediate runs in the Rampart and Creek Run areas will solve this problem. I also like the fact that these areas already are within the resort's existing permit area.""

It just goes to show you that life runs in cycles. For every down\, there's an up...etc.\, etc. I could wax on and on\, but I digress. It's our second earliest opening in resort history\, so come and help us celebrate. If you haven't reactivated your Big S Pass\, do it now at http://www.summitatsnoqualmie.com/reactivate to avoid lines of procrastinators. You'll thank me later...I promise! Here's something that isn't cyclical. It's the Evo GRAND OPENING! My sources tell me that "It's not what you'd expect...so you'd better come and see it for yourself!" This event includes all of the hottest new snowboard and ski gear\, as well as streetwear\, shoes and tons of accessories. There's a huge tent sale with gear from 30%-70% off. Brands include Ride\, K2\, Salomon\, Rossignol\, Nikita\, Oakley\, Billabong\, Element\, Etnies\, Option\, Armada and more. So if you're yearning for that special piece of equipment that you don't have yet\, you'd best check it out. The sale runs Friday-Tuesday. And if you tell them "the backcountry beast from Alpental sent me\," you get an additional 10% off at the register! But there's even more reason to attend... The GRAND OPENING also includes a movie trifecta free of charge on Saturday night- Teddy Bear Crisis\, Absinthe's "Futureproof"\, and Matchstick's "The Hit List." Film starts rolling at 6PM. That's way better than any re-runs you see on t.v. or lame "edited for time and content" movies on cable. And in the hopes that everyone will get involved\, there's the "Get Snowed In" party at Pyramid on November 18th/19th. It's a benefit for the Surfrider Foundation/Snowrider Project\, so your dollars help out a worthy cause. For more info visit: http://www.summitatsnoqualmie.com/info/winter/premieres.asp.

Here are the steps necessary for that perfect wax... Build a Kicker - Find yourself a nice steep slope away from the prying eyes of the ski patrol...

Too many other fun things going on. A special thanks to all of you who have contributed to this site! Updated - Update July 2012 I continue to receive information on home-built recumbents and have posted photos on these bikes here> A few years ago I decided that I absolutely had to have a recumbent bicycle but being a humble homesteader-type it was obvious that if I was going to ride a recumbent I'd have to build it myself. Since I am a wood worker with limited welding skills\, it seemed logical to build my bike out of wood. What followed was the construction of two wood-framed recumbents; first 'Woody' and a bit later\, 'TreeBike' and below you'll find links to the documentation of these two projects. What is Recumbent Share? Recumbent Share is a spot where recumbent bike home-builders are sharing their bikes with you! Check it out   For now though\, this part of our site is being devoted primarily to all those home builders who have sent in photos and stories of their recumbent creations. I hope you enjoy seeing and reading about these fine and very personal creations. Recumbent Share Updated 10/19/2012 Recognition for some of the folks who have sent pictures of their homebuilt recumbents. Many are made of wood\, all are great accomplishments for their builders!  Woody : This was my first adventure in wood bike building. This bike was great! Fun to ride\, and a real eye catcher. In over 2000 miles Woody never let me down. Because of its 'robustness' (weight) this bike was fast downhill\, a bit slow on the climbs. This bike has been decommissioned (a decision I sometimes regret) to make space in the bike garage. I'm sure some of its parts will be reborn in an updated design. I've left the construction sequence for Woody on the site because the information is still as valid as when it was built back in 1997. Measured drawing of Woody TreeBike : This bike was built for my wife Sue and is quite a bit lighter and more responsive than Woody. At first this bike was not too cool. Looked great\, rode crummy. It pretty much sat around and collected dust for a year. Much to my surprise\, it just needed to be adjusted a bit. I fixed front wheel alignment by filing a deeper recess in one dropout and shimmed up the rear triangle mounting to compensate for slight twist in the frame beam. This was originally to be Sue's bike but in the Spring of 2001 she got a Wizwheelz TerraTrike (check my TerraTrike Modifications page ). She has been riding the trike so I modified Treebike so I could ride it. Longest ride so far is 52 miles and although it handles badly on gravel (too much weight on rear wheel) it climbs and sprints like a champ. Background: In the summer of 1996 I bought a used Maxam DL Reveille recumbent bike. The idea was to see if I really did want to either spend big bucks for a quality manufactured bike (not likely) or at least use the Maxam to see what features I would want to incorporate into a homebuilt recumbent. The Maxam is not a bad bike. It is a little heavy at 44 lbs (including fenders and luggage rack). The components are not too bad; Shimano Alivio crank\, derailleurs and RapidFire shifters. It took me a while to get used to the thing but by the end of the Summer I could ride farther and more importantly\, more comfortably on it than on my Peugeot upright bike. The Project: The plan was to build two recumbent bikes before the Spring thaw; one each for Sue and I. The following factors were to determine the direction of the design and construction. Comfortable to ride Proper gearing to allow reasonable pedal effort in our rolling area Re-use as much of the old upright bikes as possible (frame & components) Durable enough to be trusted on extended tours Click on one of the two links above to see how the projects turned out.

(May 26\, 2015) - Dominic Scelzi powered to a pair of top 10s last weekend with the Civil War Sprint Car Series while driving for Dan Monhoff. Scelzi earned a fourth-place result on Saturday at Marysville Raceway in Marysville\, Calif.\, before wrapping up the weekend with an eighth-place finish on Sunday at Silver Dollar Speedway. "I'm really happy with the weekend\," he said. "Dan has a phenomenal race car and we've really been working hard to get me as comfortable as possible and work out the little flaws that we've struggled with. It seems like it's close to perfect every time I get in it. I'm thankful I have such a good ride." The weekend opened on Saturday with Scelzi qualifying fourth quickest out of 43 cars around Marysville Raceway. He then placed fourth in a heat race to lock himself into the dash. "We qualified strong and made it through the heat race\," he said. "That put us in the dash and on the second lap the guy behind me got into the berm and moved up and hit me. It got me way out of shape and I ended up falling to last." Scelzi rebounded to finish fourth in the dash to line up on the outside of the second row for the main event. "In the main I was following Jonathan Allard for a while\," he said. "His car got upset and I was able to get under him. I stayed in third most of the race. It looked for a bit like I could challenge for second. A yellow came out with about nine laps to go and I ended up racing hard with Sean Becker for the rest of the race." Scelzi ended fourth to mark his fourth top five of the season with Monhoff. The team headed to Silver Dollar Speedway for Sunday's event\, which began with Scelzi timing in sixth quickest of 43 cars during qualifying. He then placed third in a heat race. "Lucky for me Kyle Kirst went out and won his heat race and then Andy Forsberg won his heat race\, which put me in the dash\," he said. "I drew the No. 1 and led the first few laps. Kyle found the top and brought Willie Croft with him." Scelzi finished third in the dash to line up on the inside of the second row for the 30-lap feature. "The track was pretty slick and wide and there was a little bit around the bottom\," he said. "I got into second behind Kyle and I felt really good. As the race progressed I got tighter and tighter. It got worse and worse as the night went. I ended up losing a lot of positions. We found out after the race the left rear shock went bad." Scelzi capped the race with an eighth-place result\, which was his 12th top 10 of the season. He will compete this Friday at Keller Auto Speedway in Hanford\, Calif.\, and on Saturday for Monhoff at Placerville Speedway in Placerville\, Calif.\, with the Civil War Sprint Car Series.

The Breed and Colors Project Sponsored by The Breed and Colors Project I have compiled a master list of breeds\, and what colors are legal for those breeds. I also collected a list of colors and markings\, and found definitions of those. I am adding pictures\, colors\, and breeds as I find them. All of these deffinitions are from reliable sources\, such as encyclopedia\, popular horse information books\, breeders\, and knowledgeable horse enthusiasts. This is mostly intended for the model horse artists out there that are looking for what colors are allowed for each breed. I am adding pictures of as many breeds as I can for further reference\, and am adding pictures of the colors for reference when naming or describing a color to another artist. If you know a breed or color I missed\, please e-mail me so that I can correct this.

Monday\, February 02\, 2015 Abby's Monarch Larvae - Sharing Resources There are tons of leaves but they insisted on eating together... And there was a near disaster.... Posted by Carl\, Sandy and Abby Penwarden at 1:17 PM Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Tuesday\, November 18\, 2014 Response to Helen Dobson of Island Bay\, Dominion Post\, Letter to the Editor 31 October 2014 In response to Helen Dobson's letter to the editor\, Dominion Post\, 31 October 2014 (link and text below) where she ended by saying "It's about time that cyclists had to pay to use the road like I do\, stick to the rules and stop blaming the motorists for their unfair lot". It appears from Helens suggestion\, that she assumes that cyclists don't pay for the roads? Helen says "I saved for a number of years to get the money for my car. I pay for road user charges\, insurance\, warrant of fitness\, registration and petrol. I obey the road code." So her assertion here is that cyclists don't do these things? I do not know what percentage of cyclists also own cars\, but I would guess the number is fairly high\, and while cyclists are actually cycling they are not using their cars\, but are still paying for costs associated with owning a car. So maybe in a very high percentage of cases cyclists are actually already paying for their use of the roads? In my case I own two cars\, which I saved up for and I pay all the charges and I also obey the road code. But I choose also to ride my bike to work each day\, 20km per day\, because it is lower cost than operating a car\, it does not require parking and most of all it is good for my health. In fact studies have concluded "On average\, the estimated health benefits of cycling were substantially larger than the risks relative to car driving for individuals shifting their mode of transport." (1)So maybe in fact cyclists should receive some road user charge credit for their lower burden on the health system\, road congestion and the environment? The one group that definitely do not pay for roads are children\, and apparently their use of roads for cycling is dropping significantly\, as reported by the NZ Herald\, Mar. 13\, 2014 (2)\, the Green Party claim that "The number of children walking and cycling to primary and intermediate schools has dropped from more than 50 per cent in 1989 to 30 per cent." In the same article the following was stated as the reason for this drop\, "Studies had found that the main reason for the fall in cycling rates was the belief that biking to school was dangerous." I agree with Helen that some cyclists behaviour on the roads is unacceptable. But equally\, and certainly numerically higher\, are the number of incidences of unacceptable car driver behaviour. Unfortunately not all drivers are as impeciable as Helen and as a result the "belief that biking to school (I think biking at any time by anyone) was dangerous." has grown momentum. The perception is that cycling has got more dangerous\, and I would agree because on my commute I see cars running red lights\, drivers texting while driving and incidences of driver impatience and excess speed on a daily basis. The key difference with bad driver behaviour is that it injuries and kills cyclists. The "Cyclists crash statistics for the year ended 31December 2012" published by the Ministry of Transport (3) reports that "Between 2008 and 2012\, over 1\,500 cyclists required hospitalisation due to injuries received from crashes involving motor vehicles on public roads in New Zealand. An average of over 300 cyclists per year required hospitalisation. In the same 2008-2012 period\, 45 cyclists died in crashes involving motor vehicles on public roads. On average\, nine cyclists die each year." There are number of possible solutions to Helen's "problem"\, I will briefly discuss one possible solution. That is to improve cycling infrastructure to separate cyclists and cars in high traffic areas\, this would have two benefits. First\, it would reduce the perception of danger and increase the number of cyclist which would in turn reduce the number of cars - this is win-win in terms of safety\, health benefits\, congestion and long term roading costs. However this appears to be lost on Helen's fellow Island Bay residents many of whom have been opposing the Wellington City Councils moves to create a safer cycling route from Island Bay to the City. The second benefit arises when more New Zealanders choose to cycle then the "culture" and experience of cycling increases and overall the driving population becomes more understanding of other road users. Anyone who has cycled in Western Europe\, where cycling is more a part of everyday life and where cycling infrastructure is significantly more developed than in New Zealand\, will understand this. My wife and I have cycle toured about 15\,000km in Western Europe and we had zero incidences with vehicles\, the experience was pleasurable because drivers were considerate\, patient and understanding of sharing the roads with cyclists. We have also cycled about the same distance in New Zealand on cycling holidays where we have been hit by cars\, knocked off our bike by a truck\, had people verbally abuse us and had objects thrown at us from moving vehicles. Unfortunately that is a very sad comparison. The most concerning aspect of this is that everyone we met while cycling in New Zealand assumed we were foreign tourists (because not many kiwis cycle tour around New Zealand)\, so if that was our experience - what do foreign cycle tourists experience? - bearing in mind that tourism is our 2nd biggest industry! So there is an alternative way to look at Helen Dobson's assertions - cyclist do already pay for the roads and if there were more cyclist then the overall costs of roading would be lower. There are bad behaving cyclists but there are many more car users who do not stick to the rules and unfortunately the consequences of bad driver behaviour is often tragic. And finally\, cyclists are seeking appropriate means to improve "their lot" - but unfortunately\, if the Island Bay cycle route is an example\, it seems that some people are very selfish and shortsighted and are unable to see the greater good that cycling\, as a form of transport\, offers a society.

I pay for road user charges\, insurance\, warrant of fitness\, registration and petrol. I obey the road code. I do not undertake\, I do not run red lights\, I am observant and watch out for drivers indicating that they are turning. All so I can drive my car to my destination in good time. So why do I have to tolerate cyclists hogging the road so I have to drive at their speed\, cyclists running red lights\, undertaking me\, not watching for my turn signals and using my car to steady or propel themselves when I am at a stop? It's about time that cyclists had to pay to use the road like I do\, stick to the rules and stop blaming the motorists for their unfair lot.

OP BRIEF - The Pech River Valley\, located within 25 miles of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border\, is home to a predominantly Pashtun population\, which has expressed sympathy for the Taliban. U.S. intelligence indicates Gambir Village locals have been contracted by the Taliban to host terrorist training camps. Due to the districts close proximity to the border\, the training camps are a heavily-traveled destination for foreign fighters\, who can train and funnel back to Pakistan with ease.

Not that Utah State will get invited anytime soon. But it appeared that its popular fourth-year head coach could have had it happen. Gary Andersen\, however\, announced Nov. 30 through a school-issued press release that he will remain the head coach of the school despite heavy\, lucrative overtures from Cal and Colorado -- which recently fired their respective head coaches. That's about as good of news as anything for Utah State and its entire program as it tries to put the finishing touches Dec. 15 on what is now a school-record 10-2 season with a game against 9-3 Toledo in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl set to move the Aggies up the historical ladder a few more rungs. "I plan to remain the head football coach at Utah State University\," Andersen stated. "The interest I have received is a compliment to the quality young men in this program. Their hard work and dedication has built a culture that will enable us to continue to be successful at a very high level moving forward. In October\, Utah State athletic director Scott Barnes announced a contract extension for Andersen\, keeping him at USU through the 2018 season. Along with Andersen's revised contract\, the new deal also calls for continued salary increases for all of his assistant coaches. "I love Cache Valley\, this university and these young men\, and I am humbled and excited to continue to be the coach here. The leadership of President (Stan) Albrecht and Mr. Barnes\, as well as the support from the fans and community\, are big reasons why this is the right place for myself and my family at this time\," Andersen said. Utah State (10-2\, 6-0 WAC) just completed its most successful regular season in school history as it set single-season records for wins (10) and home wins (6)\, while recording its first outright league championship since 1936 and its 11th in school history as it became the first team in USU history to post a 6-0 conference record. Utah State also claimed possession of the Beehive Boot Trophy\, the symbol of gridiron supremacy in the state of Utah\, in 2012 for the second time in the past three seasons. The Aggies defeated Utah at home and lost\, 6-3\, at BYU. The other loss came at Wisconsin\, when a 37-yard field goal in the closing seconds was missed. Win those two games\, remain undefeated the rest of the way as the Aggies did -- including a late-November victory at nationally ranked Louisiana Tech to seal up the WAC title -- and Andersen's probably looking at some national coach of the year consideration. As it stands\, Utah State will keep Andersen. He went 4-8 in each of his first two seasons and then 7-6 last year with a disappointing finish in the same Boise\, Idaho-based game where the Aggies will play now. In all\, Utah State has now won 15 of its last 18 games to rank as the best 18-game stretch in school history since the 1962-64 teams also won 15 of 18 games. NOTES\, QUOTES PLAYERS TO WATCH: --RB Kerwynn Williams ranks 11th in the nation in all-purpose yards (163.0)\, 23rd in rushing (106.4)\, and tied for 34th in the nation in scoring (8.5). One of the country's most unheralded players\, this will be a nationally televised showcase to show his value. NFL scouts will be watching\, for sure\, especially after the rookie-year pro success two former running back teammates (Robert Turbin of Seattle\, Michael Smith at Tampa Bay) are enjoying this year. And Williams even offers more versatility. --Sophomore quarterback Chuckie Keeton ranks second in the WAC and 14th in the nation in passing efficiency (156.7)\, and 17th in the nation in total offense (305.9). He had a major self-realization about how to run the offense after the heartbreaking 6-3 loss at BYU in early October. --Senior cornerback Will Davis gets picked on. But he picks back. Davis leads the nation in passes defended (1.75)\, 11th in the nation in interceptions (0.42)\, with five interceptions this year. His ability to play "on the island" in 1-on-1 coverage allows USU to implement a roaming strategy for its two strong safeties that gets them closer to the line of scrimmage to help on run support. --WR Matt Austin is second only to Kerwynn Williams in receptions (43 to 42)\, but look for the well regarded senior to get some extra passes thrown his way in the bowl game. He's been through a ton of injuries\, including a devastating knee injury a few years ago that nearly ended his career. The Aggies will try to send him out the right way\, including with a few targets his way from Chuckie Keeton. BOWL HISTORY: Utah State\, who also played in the 2011 Famous Idaho Potato Bowl\, losing to Ohio in the closing seconds\, is appearing in back-to-back bowl games for just the third time in school history joining the 1946 Raisin Bowl and 1947 Grape Bowl teams. Also\, the 1960 Sun Bowl and 1961 Gotham Bowl teams. Overall\, it is USU's eighth bowl appearance in school history and Utah State has won just twice. QUOTE TO NOTE: "We just want to keep this going. Get one more win together." -- Utah State senior running back Kerwynn Williams\, on getting what would be a school-record 11 wins in a year by avenging last year's loss at the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL BOWL BREAKDOWN: Scouting the running game: It centers around senior Kerwynn Williams\, who had 1\,277 yards on the ground and averaged 6.4 yards per carry. What may say the most about his attack\, and the offensive line creating holes for him\, was that in 200 attempts Williams only lost a total of 64 yards for the season. He set up reasonable third-down situations all season. Quarterback Chuckie Keeton is next in line\, averaging 4.4 yards on 120 attempts. Scouting the passing game: Chuckie Keeton is one of the most versatile quarterbacks in the west. Only a sophomore\, he is strong at extending the time of plays by moving around the pocket. He's gotten better this season at managing his check-down options. Completed 67 percent of his passes and threw 27 TD's compared to nine interceptions. Scouting the run defense: Ranks in the top 15 in the country\, as head coach Gary Andersen and first-year defensive coordinator Dave Aranda -- formerly of Hawaii -- have united to create a unit that allows less than three (actually 2.9) yards per carry on the ground. Linebacker Jake Doughtry\, a former walk-on\, leads USU with 72 tackles as he manages the line of scrimmage. Scouting the pass defense: Utah State ranks eighth nationally in sacks (3.25 per game) and Zach Vigil is the prime reason why. He had 5.5 of them\, and 9.5 total tackles for loss. USU's numbers are a touch skewed because it had a school-record 13 against San Jose State in one game. Intangibles: Nationally\, Utah State is one of just 18 teams with 10 or more wins on the season and USU is one of just four teams across the country who have not lost a league game joining Ohio State (8-0) from the Big Ten and Kent State (8-0) and Northern Illinois (8-0) from the Mid-American Conference. Neither the Aggies are Toledo lost to a team that isn't going to a bowl game. Utah State is comfortable and certainly excited to head to the Boise\, Idaho\, bowl game\, close to home. And there's certainly a lot of excitement at advancing the team's first season with a national ranking in nearly 20 years. ROSTER REPORT --It will be the first meeting between Utah State and Toledo at the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. --Utah State is 7-2 against Mid-American Conference teams\, including a 24-23 loss last year to Ohio in the same bowl game.

This time last year the single-minded Scot was dumped out of Wimbledon after losing a tight semi-final to Andy Roddick. If he goes one better on the parched lawns of SW19 this year against Rafael Nadal\, he will be one match away from becoming the first British champion since Fred Perry in 1936. The pundits give Murray a fair chance in Friday's semi-final clash. He is in the shape of his life with a rigorous fitness regime - eating up to 50 servings of sushi a night and drinking six litres of water a day\, according to newspaper reports. 'Anti-English' So what do we know about the only British man to reach two Grand Slam finals (he lost both to Roger Federer) since the 1930s? The 23-year-old has become a household name over the past five years but not always for the right reasons. Despite last year becoming the highest-ranked British male since Perry by reaching number two\, he remains a figure many fans have struggled to warm to. Judy Murray and Kim Sears are regular supporters on Centre Court Some of the resentment\, played out in the press\, can be traced to his World Cup comment in 2006. During an interview\, he joked he would cheer on anyone but England during the football tournament in Germany - words which have dogged him ever since. Murray has insisted he is "not anti-English and never was" and that his light-hearted comment was taken out of context. And sources close to Murray say he has a very dry humour\, which is often lost in translation. But he has struggled to shake the anti-English label\, despite the fact his grandmother is English. This year\, when the Queen made her first visit to Wimbledon for 33 years\, there was much speculation in the papers about whether Murray would bow to her. 'Pushy mum' The Scot had hinted he was unsure\, and would "wait and see" what other players would do\, but when it came to it\, he bowed three times to cheers from the crowd. Fiery and focused\, he is a player of few words and even fewer smiles\, but his recent reconciliation with long-term girlfriend Kim Sears after they split up last year is likely to have put a few back on his face. Andy and Kim met before he was a big name\, at the US Open in 2005 - her father is the tennis coach Nigel Sears. MURRAY'S RISE AND RISE Born in Glasgow Joined tennis academy in Barcelona aged 15 Won BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in 2004 Career prize money 7.5m Won 14 ATP tour titles The 22-year-old is studying for a degree in English Literature at Sussex University and has lived at Murray's Surrey mansion along with their border terrier Maggi. She has been credited with helping Murray lighten up off court\, and is a regular in the player's box on Centre Court alongside Andy's ever-present mother Judy. A tennis coach and former Scottish champion\, Judy is often accused of being "a pushy mum"\, but even if she is\, both Andy and his brother Jamie - a Wimbledon mixed doubles champion in his own right - do not seem to mind one bit. The cameras often focus on Judy as she lends vocal support to her sons whenever they play. More recently another girl has made Murray grin on court - his new mixed doubles partner Laura Robson. The 16-year-old paired up with the Scot at the Hopman Cup in Perth in January 2010 - and they eventually finished as runners-up\, enjoying a few laughs along the way. Right-handed Murray is 6ft 3in\, weighs just over 13 stone and started playing tennis at the age of three. He was raised in the Perthshire town of Dunblane\, and was at school there when gunman Thomas Hamilton walked in and killed 16 children and one adult in 1996. Rich list He was not in the same class\, did not witness the shootings and rarely talks about it. A mop-headed and gangly Andy Murray first came to the British public's attention during his Wimbledon debut in 2005. He has not been allowed to forget the moment he got cramp when he was two sets up against the former Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian. Robson and Murray were runners-up in the Hopman Cup in January 2010 Unjust criticism about his fitness followed - the press were also not enamoured of his gruff demeanour. Murray has done a lot of growing since then - both mentally and physically. He has warmed\, not to the press per se\, but to the fact that facing their questions is part of the modern game. His fitness level can be measured not only by his reaching two Grand Slam finals - at the 2008 US Open and the Australian Open of 2010 - but also his willingness to flex his "guns" as much as he can. In his pull-no-punches autobiography - Hitting Back - published in 2008\, it is obvious that all he wants to do is win a Grand Slam. It also revealed that the tennis ace would give former British number one Tim Henman a run for his money in the clean-living stakes. He loathes smoking\, hates partying and is a teetotaller - he tried alcohol once but ended up throwing up outside a nightclub in Barcelona. According to his father Will - he and Judy split when Murray was just nine - the two brothers are completely different animals. In an interview last year\, he said: "Jamie is so outgoing\, an entirely different personality from Andy who can be temperamental. Murray competing in the boys' competition at Wimbledon in 2004 "Everyone has their own ways of reacting to situations and\, in the heat of battle\, it's never easy to keep your emotions in check." His family says Andy was born ultra-competitive and his backbone of discipline\, and perhaps also his athleticism\, comes from his grandfather - a staunch Presbyterian who played for Hibernian Football Club. Murray is ranked sixth in the Sunday Times's latest top 10 Young Rich Sports Millionaires List\, one place ahead of footballer Joe Cole. Murray's fortune has risen from 12m last year to 15m in 2010. With his fame and fortune on the rise\, many would argue that Murray could become Britain's best ever player. Some say he has already made it\, but Murraymania or Andymonium aside\, the real judge of that will be the fans. Ask those inside the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club without Centre Court tickets where they are watching the semi-final and most will tell you Murray Mount. The diehard Tim Henman fans will argue it is still Henman Hill\, since he reached the semi-final at Wimbledon four times. But if Murray triumphs over Spaniard and world number one Nadal on Friday\, they may find themselves in a losing battle.

Whether you like to play roulette online or you like games of strategy\, luck and skill such as chess and snooker you will like five-pin bowling. The pins aren't as big as they are in tenpin bowling. Also the ball isn't as heavy. The balls in five pin bowling can fit in the palm of your hand. They have no holes for your fingers. Scoring is simple. The central pin is worth five\, those on either side of it are three and the two on the outside are two.

Older Entries Groenendyk\, Huls\, Dunker\, Ulin\, and DeMint Visit Lee County Speedway Victory Lane May 24th\, 2015 | Author: Brian Neal by Brian Neal Donnellson\, IA (Friday\, May 22\, 2015)  After two straight weeks of rain outs the Lee County Speedway in Donnellson\, Iowa got back to action on Friday night with PEPSI Memphis Bottling Night. When the final checkered flag waved Tyler Groenendyk (Budweiser IMCA Modifieds)\, Abe Huls (Donnellson Tire and Service IMCA Stock Cars)\, Tony Dunker (Shottenkirk of Ft. Madison IMCA SportMods)\, Nick Ulin (Coors Light IMCA Hobby Stocks)\, and Travis DeMint (Armstrong Tractor IMCA Sport Compacts) found their way to victory lane. The 15 lap Armstrong Tractor IMCA Sport Compact feature was the first to take to the track\, with Brandon Lambert and Barry Taft leading the field to the drop of the green flag. Lambert would take advantage of his front row starting spot to grab the lead on lap 1 over Brandon Reu\, who started 6th\, and William Michel. Reu worked the bottom of the track to slip under Lambert for the top spot on lap 3. The action up front was slowed on lap 4\, when debris in turn 4 brought out a caution. On the restart Reu jumped back out front\, but now had Travis DeMint\, who started 9th\, glued to his back bumper. DeMint tried to get around Reu for the lead over the next 4 laps\, but Reu was able to hold him off each lap. That was until lap 9\, when DeMint was able to slip under Reu to grab the lead. DeMint then led the final 7 laps to claim his second win of the season at the track. Reu held on for 2nd\, Kimberly Abbott started 8th and finished 3rd\, Lambert was 4th\, with Josh Barnes\, who fell to last on the start\, recovering to finish in 5th. Up next was the 14 lap Coors Light IMCA Hobby Stock feature\, with Kevin Koontz and Nick Ulin on the front row. Ulin used his front row starting spot to jump out into the lead on lap 1 over Dustin Griffiths\, and Brandon Symmonds. Griffiths would look under Ulin over the entire 14 laps\, as Symmonds followed both of them waiting for them to make a mistake. But Ulin was able to hold on the entire 14 laps to pick up his first win of the season at the track. Griffiths settled for 2nd\, Symmonds was 3rd\, John Irwin was 4th\, with Koontz rounding out the top 5. Brandon Ruffcorn and Brian Woodruff was suppose to lead the field to the green in the 20 lap Shottenkirk of Ft. Madison IMCA SportMod feature\, but when Woodruff elected to go to the rear that would move Austin Howes to the outside of the front row. Just as the green flag waved the yellow light would come on\, as Ashton Johnson spun in turn 4 to bring out the caution. On the restart Ruffcorn moved out front to lead lap 1 over Howes and Phillip Cossel. Howes\, who was working the top of the track\, was able to take the top spot away from Ruffcorn on lap 2. The action up front was slowed on lap 3 when Travis Hartman came to a stop in turn 2 to bring out the yellow. Howes jumped back out front on the restart\, with Cossel over taking Ruffcorn for the runner up spot. While Howes set the pace out front\, Adam Birck\, who started 10th\, Joey Gower\, who started 11th\, and Tony Dunker\, who started 12th\, were working their way towards the front. Howes lead\, which was a half a straight away\, was wiped out on lap 8 when Colton Bowman spun in turn 4 to bring out the yellow. On the restart a tire was clipped in turn 4 and pushed out onto the track to bring the caution light back on. The following restart saw Howes move back out front over Birck and Gower. Birck\, who was working the bottom of the track\, was able to slip under Howes to grab the lead away on lap 14. At the same time Dunker joined the battle up front to make it a three car battle for the top spot. With Birck and Howes both working the bottom of the track\, Dunker decided to got to the top. Coming to the white flag Dunker was able to take over the lead. But Birck wouldnt give up as he pulled even with Dunker coming off turn 2. Dunker would use the momentum off of turn 4 coming to the checkered flag to pick up his first win of the season at the track. Birck settled for 2nd\, Howes was 3rd\, Robert Gould was 4th\, with Ruffcorn coming home in 5th. Up next was the 20 lap Donnellson Tire and Service IMCA Stock Car feature\, with Ryan Fullenkamp and Jim Redmann making up the front row. Redmann took advantage of his front row starting spot to grab the lead on lap 1 over Jeremy Pundt and Fullenkamp. Redmann\, who was working the top\, and Pundt\, who was working the bottom\, ran the second lap side-by-side. Pundt would use the bottom of the track to edge out Redmann for the top spot on lap 3. Just as lap 3 was scored complete Jason See spun in turn 2 to bring out the caution. On the restart Andrew Hustead\, who was running 4th\, spun in turn 4 to bring the yellow light back on. The following restart saw Redmann get into the back of Pundt\, who spun in turn 3 and collected Derrick Agee\, who started 10th and had worked his way to 5th\, to bring the yellow light back on. A third attempt of a restart saw Abe Huls\, who started 6th\, slip under Fullenkamp to take the top spot\, with David Brandies\, who started 7th\, close behind in 3rd. Brandies would slip under Fullenkamp on lap 5 to move into second and then set his sights on Huls for the lead. Huls and Brandies\, who were both running the bottom\, then started to pull away from the two wide racing going on behind them. Brandies tried to get under Huls for the top spot over the next 10 laps\, but Huls was able to hold him off every lap. Then coming off turn 2 on lap 14 Brandies was able to get up beside Huls\, as the two raced into turn 3. Contact between the two resulted into Brandies cutting down a right rear tire\, as he pulled into the infield on lap 15 to end his night. From there Huls pulled away to claim his third win of the season at the track. Jason Cook\, who started 11th\, was able to slip under Nathan Wood\, who started 8th\, on the last lap to finish 2nd\, with Wood in 3rd\, Pundt recovered from the spin on lap 3 to come back up to finish 4th\, with Fullenkamp holding on for 5th. The final feature to take to the track on the night was the 20 lap Budweiser IMCA Modifieds\, with AJ Johnson and Jerad Fuller leading the field to the drop of the green flag. Johnson would take advantage of his starting spot to grab the lead on lap 1 over Fuller and Jeff Waterman. Johnson\, who was running the bottom\, and Fuller\, who was up top\, ran the first 7 laps side-by-side with Johnson edging out in front on each lap. That was until lap 8\, when Fuller was able to taker the top spot away. Once Johnson got passed he would move to the top of the track\, which allowed Tyler Groenendyk to use the bottom to make it a three car battle for the top spot. Coming off turn 4 on lap 11 Groenendyk was able to edge out Fuller at the line to take over the top spot. One lap later\, lap 12\, Ryan Cook\, who was running 7th\, spun in turn 2 to bring out the yellow. On the restart Groenendyk jumped back out front\, with Fuller\, Johnson\, Scott Hogan and Bill Roberts Jr. battling for second. The final 8 laps went caution free\, with Groenendyk pulling away to pick up his second win of the season at the track. Fuller won the battle for 2nd\, Roberts Jr. was 3rd\, Johnson was 4th\, with Hogan rounding out the top 5.

Presque Isle Cycling Club Events & Results | Links & Sponsors | Join | Officers & Contacts | Message Board | Future Presque Isle Cycling Club The Premier Bicycle Club in Northwestern Pennsylvania New Bicycle Law went into effect April 2nd\, 2012 You may have read about the new PA safe passing of bicycles now requiring motorists to allow 4 foot while passing cyclists on the road. It was recently passed by the PA Legistature and signed by Governor Corbett. It required motor vehicle drivers to give cyclists 4 feet clearance when passing\, even if they have to go across a yellow line to do so safely\, or slow down to a prudent speed and wait until any oncoming traffic is clear so they can safely pass with the required 4 foot clearance. Also after taking over a cyclists\, they cannot make a sudden right hand turn in the path of a cyclists going straight. Likewise it also requires cyclists to ride to the right as far as safely possible\, but does allow riders to move away from the right hand curb to avoid any hazards\, or when making a left hand turn\, or passing. More information can be obtained about the law at PA Walks and Bikes PICC and a new Bicycle Erie Inititive Bicycle Erie's mission is to assist in creating livable communities by promoting all forms of cycling and advocating for the rights and equality of the bicycling community. A new group supported by PICC to achieve the national Bicycle Friendly Community designation for Erie. Their Vision statement is simply Erie neighborhoods are designed\, built\, and maintained to foster bicycling\, walking and public transit. For transportation\, recreation\, and sport\, bicycling and walking are viable and safe options and ideal tools for active\, healthy lifestyles. They would like your help!

May was Bicycle Month- Bike to Work During the month of May Bicycle Month and Bicycle to Work Week specifically was held on Monday\, May 14th through Friday\, May 18th of this year but anytime is a good time to start trying to get the 2 wheel human powered vehicle- AKA bringyour bicycle out to commute to work instead of your usual 4 wheel vehicle. With gasoline prices approaching $4.00 locally\, Friday\, May 18th was the official Bike to Work Day for 2012 as designated from the League of American Bicyclists LAB Web Site for added details. Also as part of the 2010 lead up to this week the Presque Isle Cycling Club was on WQLN Radio's "Weekend All Things Erie" with Kim Young. President Greg Troyer and Eric Brozell were interviewed about Bike Month and commuting to Work. WQLN Radio Tuesdays at the Peninsula- 2012 The weekly Peninsula rides are off and going\, even as the days get shorter. The start time traditionally is 6:00 at Beach 1 Parking Lot at the first parking lot to the left after the park entrance. 2012 ride season at the Presque Isle State Park is finally here stating Tuesday\, March 13th. These rides tend to have a faster paced group that work on pace line riding- pace starts at a slow warm up for the first part of the ride\, but can accelerate quickly. Expect a hard work-out to keep up with the pack of top area riders. You can either ride with the group (if you safely understand the pace line protocol) or ride with the B group. This second group- more informal is a "go at your own pace"\, finish the loop when you can. Meet at 6:00 PM (Some of the Group still meet earlier than 6:00 pm to take advantage of additional laps especially later in the season when daylight is becoming a premium)\, weather permitting of course. Weds. Nights- 2012 The Wednesday night group rides return with one of the earliest start dates in recent years Weds\, March 14th\, 2012. Traditionally these in the past have start at the Edinboro University Parking Lot just past the stadium on Perry Lane and opposite of the McComb Fieldhouse (past the main entrance off Route 6N). Permission has been granted to use the rest rooms in McComb Fieldhouse. These rides start at 6:00 PM and routes and distances can vary each week and are group appropriate. When the weather reports are showing rain in the area or if it is raining at the start\, the rides will be cancelled due to safety of all involved. More details on Events & Results page for additional info on the 2012 ride updates and details as available. Meeting Info Meetings of the PICC are held the second Monday of each month during the winter months\, starting at 7:00 PM. for the board meeting. During the summer in 2012 we will meet typically on the 2nd Tuesday after the Peninsula Training rides (starting at 7:15 pm) at Walker Properties\, 2820 W. 21st St. (Ebco Park) -off Peninsula Dr. and W. 23rd St. Drink and snack vending machines are available. The board meetings are primarily a business meeting\, but are open to all members and guests. Merchandise Show off your style! The club has limited inventory of jerseys and socks available for purchase. The jerseys are available in sleeveless and short sleeve (limited sizes only)\, and long sleeve styles (most sizes still available). These Louis Garneau customized jerseys are top quality and very comfortable. The PICC socks are white and blue with small (5- 9 shoe) only are still available.

Fayetteville Observer - 3 Feb 00 The Fayetteville Observer February 3\, 2000 Harriers run anywhere at any time By J.S. Newton Staff writer The temperature is hovering around freezing. But there they go again\, running through snow and sleet. Some wear shorts. One wears a Viking helmet -- horns protruding from the top. Staff photo by Marcus Castro Carolina Trash Hash House harriers go down a hill together in freezing temperatures as they follow a trail through Waters Edge. It could be 105 degrees or minus 5 degrees. Every Sunday\, you will find these runners out making their weekly round. In their 848 Sunday jaunts -- through swamp\, mud\, thickets and even chilly Fort Bragg lakes -- the Carolina Trash Hash House Harriers have yet to cancel a run. Weve even run under Fayetteville\, through underground cement pipes\, said Richard Cancellieri\, a 30-year-old Army specialist. We call them chug runs. You are in water up to your waist. The Carolina Trash Hash House Harriers is one of many Hash groups throughout the world. The group mixes running who-knows- where with beer drinking to create an off-beat social club\, whose only goal is to have fun. Their annual events include red-dress runs\, in which all the runners -- men and women -- wear red evening gowns of their choosing. Runners frequently get prizes for unusual achievements\, like a rubber ball for the biggest whiner. Or awards for the Hasher who gets the most cuts and abrasions. After all\, achievement among Hashers is measured in stumbles and giggles -- not timed victories. Where Hashing all began Rumor has it\, the tradition of traipsing over hill and dale was started in Kuala Lumpur in the late 1930s by A. S. G Gispert . He became a member of the Federated Malay States Volunteer Reserves\, which trained on Mondays. He and many of the other expatriate Brits on Kuala Lumpur were housed in barracks in the Royal Selangor Club where they would often discuss starting a running club. About December 1938\, Gispert persuaded nearly a dozen men to follow his inaugural trail run\, according to The Harrier Page\, a Web site that gives the history of Hashing. Gispert suggested the name of Hash House Harriers in mock allusion to the mess at the Selangor Club\, where many of the Hashers dined. The runs were on Monday evenings after reserve training and were followed by refreshments of Tiger beer\, the Web page says. Gispert never got a chance to see his club blossom. He was killed defending Singapore from Japan on Feb. 11\, 1942. Maj. Chuck Squirt Adkins\, a 43-year-old Hasher\, says the U.S. Air Force formed the first U.S. Hash House Harrier club in 1973. Adkins is a quartermaster with Fort Braggs 1st Corps Support Command. He has been on Hash runs throughout the world. One was with a group of Dutch soldiers stationed with the Multinational Force and Observers in Egypt. They ran through the desert\, he said. That was pretty fun. It was about 105 degrees. The Carolina Hashers group has runners from all walks of life. But many have a military background. Their runs are just that\, runs. Not races. Race is a four-letter word\, said Dave Bullen\, who before he began working as a county employee was a Fort Bragg soldier. We dont use the word race. About 90 percent of the group have military ties of some nature. The group has a loosely enforced set of guidelines. There are absolutely no rules\, Cancellieri said. Only traditions. The runs are done in typical British hunting fashion. A hare sets out 15 minutes before the rest of the runners\, called hounds. The hare drops off clues in the form of baking flour. On Sunday\, the flour was mixed with colored drink mix so that it would stand out in the snow. The hounds must follow the hares path. Along the way\, the hares place cold beer at designated check points. They also try to throw the pack off their scent by laying down false trails. And just as a wild hare runs through prickly bushes and hops across creeks\, so do the runners. The hare can take them anywhere\, runners say. One time\, the course took them on a quarter-mile swim across Mott Lake on post\, a Hasher said. Everybody had to swim for part of the trail\, said Sgt. Pete Walther\, a soldier with the 1st Special Warfare Training Group. Part of the point is just to see how messy you can get\, he said. Sometimes the medical folks come in handy\, said Cancellieri\, a.k.a. L.C. Smurf. Not to be confused with Bullen\, a.k.a. Stinky. Runners who set a trail just once get a nickname\, given to them by the rest of the group. Runners also carry whistles to keep from getting lost. They sign in at the start of each run in a log book. If somebody is missing\, we will go back and find them\, Bullen said. Capt. Francis Park\, a staff officer with the 82nd Airborne Division\, said he enjoys Hashing. His nickname\, which he did not choose\, is too profane to print. Its a neat way to meet people\, he said. And its a good reason to actually get out and run.  The Fayetteville (N.C.)

A FIFA perp walk begins. Noted crook Jack Warner and CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb were among those arrested on Tuesday night (alternate link for those unable to see the NYT report). Let's hope it continues and we get some change at FIFA before everyone's tummy is as sour as mine is today about the game. Thus far\, Sepp Blatter is free and clear... but for how long? - Greg Seltzer Posted by Greg Seltzer at 5:29 AM 3 comments: Labels: by Greg Seltzer \, CONCACAF \, FIFA \, football corruption \, Jack Warner One nervous wait\, coming right up. I just spoke to the Molde FK medical chief and the initial MRI scan on Josh Gatt 's hard-luck left knee has been found to be inconclusive. That means we all wait along with the winger and his club for as much as another week while they consult with the surgeon who performed his last knee op for a second opinion. I can tell you the club is trying to remain positive\, even if it has to be difficult to pull off by this point. I will have a full report up at MLSS\, but it may be a few hours before anyone gets into the office in NYC. - Greg Seltzer Posted by Greg Seltzer at 4:46 AM No comments: Labels: Americans Abroad \, by Greg Seltzer \, Norway Tuesday\, May 26\, 2015 A forced pause Forgive my silence these last days\, I caught a harsh case of food poisoning this weekend and I am still trying to rest my way back to 100% before the Under-20 World Cup kicks off.

Pyunik ace Cesar Romero bagged the fast opener in last night's title-clinching 3-1 home win over Gandzasar. It was his 20th of the season (tying him for tops in the league with two games left) and 25th overall this term. Congrats\, Cesar & Co.!! - Greg Seltzer Posted by Greg Seltzer at 9:58 AM 5 comments: Labels: Americans Abroad \, by Greg Seltzer \, Mexico \, Videos Wednesday\, May 20\, 2015 More Alfredo Sauce I will be back home from Africa late tonight\, so that means goodie season opens in earnest tomorrow. But I can tell you that freshly-crowned 2.Bundesliga champs Ingolstadt are working hard on a contract extension for key man Alfredo Morales . His contract is set to expire at the end of June\, but you can probably expect a resolution much sooner than that. - Greg Seltzer Posted by Greg Seltzer at 3:58 AM No comments: Labels: Americans Abroad \, by Greg Seltzer \, Germany Tuesday\, May 19\, 2015 Let me get this straight... So smoldering Qatar can bribe their way into hosting the World Cup 2022 with a bunch of nonsense technological promises\, move the tourney to winter\, run the contruction of what essentially amounts to a city for the tourney on slave labor and now arrest journalists they invited to document the conditions experienced by those imported slaves without any repercussions whatsoever\, but CONMEBOL may be stripped of a berth if FIFA thinks the sanctions handed to club side Boca Juniors over a single incident are not severe enough. What in the proper f***? I have said it before and I will say it again: I will not cover or even watch a single minute of a World Cup held in Qatar in 2022. Hell to the no. I would ask how these people look in a mirror\, but clearly they have no reflections. - Greg Seltzer Posted by Greg Seltzer at 4:39 AM 7 comments: Labels: by Greg Seltzer \, CONMEBOL \, FIFA \, football corruption \, Qatar \, World Cup 2022 Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom) Cut of the Day No clue why I would want to follow Les Twins... but my first popping freestyle video in two years is up.

I haven't left the gymnasium where Peter performed and I've already received feedback from quite a few staff members regarding his performance today.

What is fsed? blogs fsed is the brainchild of World Champion Rope Jumper\, and Guinness World Records Setting Unicyclist**\, Peter Nestler. A unique amalgamation of performance art\, this show fuses together various live elements to create one of the most engaging and sought-after programs in the world. Combining his mastery of rope skipping (which has affectionately brought him the nickname of Rope Master)\, the athletic prowess of unicycling\, the art of poi spinning\, glow-in-the-dark ropes\, audience participation and motivational speaking\, fused is the must-see show for schools. Peter has performed all over the world since he began jumping rope in 1986. His program has been seen in such countries as Australia\, Bahamas\, British Virgin Islands\, Cambodia\, Canada\, Denmark\, France\, Germany\, Kenya\, Mexico\, New Zealand\, Nigeria\, Peru\, South Korea\, Sweden\, Tanzania\, Thailand and Vietnam. He has performed in every state in the US and has been seen on television programs such as Fox News and ESPN\, as well as worked with Men's Health Magazine and the Wall Street Journal. Due to his expertise in rope skipping he also was contracted to double for Adam Sandler in Jack & Jill for a Double Dutch scene in the movie. **Peter has the official Guinness World Records record for most skips in one minute on a unicycle (237). He also has 9 additional Guinness World Records including the most skips in one minute while juggling a football. Jumping Rope on Stilts March 25th I am now a double digit Guinness World Records holder! That's right\, this past weekend I broke my 10th title (and broke one of my previous records again). This time I set the record for completing the most skips on stilts in one minute. It took me quite some time to find the perfect set of stilts where I could actually jump on them. Check out the video and read on for some more info about the record attempt. Read More... Jump Rope Video Contest January 20th I'm currently performing and teaching over in Nigeria! It's going great and I look forward to sharing some of the details when I get back in the States. I was invited to judge a video contest put on by a friend of mine. If you would like to take part\, it's a great opportunity to show off your jump rope moves! I've put all the details below\, make sure you check it out and put together a video and submit it by Feb. 26th. You can win some free jump ropes for you or your school/team! Read More... World Record Fan Choice of the Year January 8th I need your VOTE! My Guinness World Records title for the fastest 100 meters jumping rope on one leg (what a mouthful) is in the finals for the Fan Choice of the Year. VOTE HERE . The winner is determined solely by how many votes they get and I need every vote possible if I want to stand a chance at winning. Last year a jump rope record (most jumps in one hour) won the event and it would be awesome if another jump rope record won again this year! Please vote and then pass it along to every one you know. Voting ends Jan. 13th so vote soon and please pass it along! **Quick Note. When my wife went to vote on her phone it said that her vote had already been counted. It looks like they only allow one vote per internet connection (ip address) so if more than one person in your house goes to vote\, make sure you are on your phone not wifi or it won't count. Thank you. Read More... Learn to Jump Rope Online December 7th Exciting news! We just launched a new website (sister or brother site depending on your bent). This website has been in the works for a while and it's purpose is to make all of our instructional videos available in a streaming fashion. Jump Rope Secrets is now your source for the best in rope skipping instruction. Streaming? What's that? Basically\, we have taken every video we've ever created and put them in the cloud.

Hop on over and sign up for a Silver account for free and check out some videos to get an idea of what we're talking about. Oh yeah\, when we say everything\, we mean everything. Read More... A Pace to Rival the Power of Aquaman October 25th I finally got the video uploaded. It's a very shortened version of the total video as I think watching an hour of this would get old in a hurry. I have to thank my very patient judges as they had to be intently watching the entire time to make sure they counted every jump. Also\, if you're into reading newspaper articles\, the News Observer in Raleigh ran a story on this which you can read by Clicking Here . My favorite line is where he says I jumped at "a pace to rival the power of Aquaman." So the moral of the story\, even Aquaman wouldn't be a fast rope jumper underwater. The truth hurts even superheroes. Read More... Underwater Rope Skipping Record Shattered October 14th Yesterday I broke my 9th current Guinness World Records title\, this one was for jumping rope underwater the most times in one hour! What!? How does that work? That seems to be the overwhelming response I get when I tell someone what I was training for. Well\, it's hard to describe\, but basically\, you jump rope while holding your breath as many times as you can for an hour. But no one can hold their breath that long. True...but you don't have to do the whole thing on just one breath. I'll explain that in a moment\, but to let you in on what I mean by shattered: old world record = 900. New world record = 1\,871. This Guinness World Records machine strikes again! Read More... Seventeen Years is Too Many October 8th A couple weeks ago Alicia and I headed down to Florida. We had some shows in the area\, but timed the trip to coincide with my old jump rope partner and his wife visiting Disney. We had a blast hanging out as this was the first time we have had no obligations except for just having some fun. While we were there I was able to setup dinner with another ex-teammate. In fact\, this was the first time in 17 years that the three of us had been together. Son Nguyen\, Trent Cunningham and Peter Nestler. It certainly doesn't look like it now\, but back in the day\, we were quite the team (along with James Mothershead and Josh Bonk). Read More... Guinness World Records Machine October 6th This past year I have really been getting some traction from this Guinness World Records thing. I'll find out next week whether I will be on a TV show that is looking to feature some world record holders (keeping it on the low down until I find out for sure). Today I received an email from Guinness that one of my records is part of their "Fan Choice". VOTE HERE if you would like to support this one (make sure you vote for 'fastest 100 m jumping rope on one leg). In the description they posted about my record I'm referred to as "a bit of a Guinness World Records Machine". Who wouldn't love that title? Read More...  I want to personally welcome you to my website. Over the past 29 years I've had many great opportunities to travel the globe performing as a master rope jumper and unicyclist. Now I want to bring what I've learned to you. Whether you're interested in booking a live performance or picking up one of my world-class instructional dvd's. I would love to spend some time with you teaching and showing what rope skipping is all about. All the work and all the years that I've been practicing\, it's all been for you. One rope\, one wheel\, one word...fsed.

Harness Racing at Harnessracing.biz HOME HARNESS RACING TRACKS Balmoral Park Cal Expo Dover Downs Hazel Park Hoosier Park Maywood Park Meadowlands Mohawk Racetrack Monticello Northfield Park Pocono Downs Pompano Park Rockingham Park Saratoga Scioto Downs The Meadows The Red Mile Hawthorne Hoosier Park Woodbine Yonkers Racetrack HARNESS RACING BETS HARNESS BETTING TIPS BET NOW Harness Racing A harness race is a race involving people riding in sulkies behind horses. A sulky is a light\, open two-wheeled vehicle accommodating only the driver that is drawn by a horse. Harness racing is contested on two gaits\, the trot and the pace. A gait is a horse's manner of walking or running on foot. Trotters move with a diagonal gait; the left front and right rear legs move in unison\, as do the right front and left rear. Pacers\, on the other hand\, move their legs on one side of their body in tandem: left front and rear\, and right front and rear. This action shows why pacers are often called "sidewheelers." Pacers account for about 80% of the participants in harness racing\, and are aided in maintaining their gait by plastic loops called hobbles\, which keep their legs moving in synchronization. Trotters are more popular in Europe while pacers are more popular the North America. The Standardbred is the fastest horse in harness\, and is the most popular trotting / pacing breed. The standardbred horse was founded on Messenger\, a thoroughbred that was imported from England in 1788. However\, he didn't race in harness. The foundation sire was an in-bred descendent of Messenger named Hambletonian 10 who was foaled in 1849. The first harness races were held along city roads\, with men challenging their friends to see who had the swifter steed. Often the streets of major cities were cleared and races held. Hence\, so many American cities have a Race Street. Harness races later became a popular attraction at many county fairs. Today\, there is a large concentration of harness racing tracks in the Northeast and Midwest United States. Virtually every major population center in these areas boasts one or more harness tracks. The sport is also popular in Florida\, California\, and throughout Canada. Each year in North America\, over 30 million people attend harness racing events.

The 6W Ranch Training Center The 6W Ranch     "A horse has no future. It cannot greet the sun and say today will be better. It can only reflect upon days of past experiences. It is our job to create a positive past." ~The 6W Ranch Dedicated to: Abby\, the Mustang Police Horse Foaled 1991\, End of Watch-October 19 th \, 2013 A Classical Training Experience For the Dedicated Equestrian Student of Horsemanship On numerous occasions I have been confronted with the intelligence of horses in the course of their training. They rewarded the patience with which I tried to understand their characters by giving their best\, just as they manifested their unwillingness when I demanded too much or had been unjust or too fast in their training. These are the moments of truth when the rider has to pause and reconsider his line of conduct. Whenever there are disagreements it is best to seek the fault in oneself. ~ Alois Podhajsky  Site Index  The Pendulum Method CD Learn how you and your wild horse respond to body language and how your horse sees things you dont even know that you are doing.

(Right\, Jacquie Crews? And Kate L\, hope you and that little poor\, poor\, picked on girl appreciated the CD. You must have since your request for a FREE CD for this poor child came on the heels of Jacquies (drunken?) tirade and never as much as a thank you from the oppressed child or you.

A complete list of softball links and a message board is available also as is a page of thanks for all the people that have helped and contributed to this site. Thanks for stopping by - Steve   Bill Plummer III \, Amateur Softball Association (ASA) Hall of Fame Manager\, announced his retirement effective as of December 31\, 2009 and will be stepping down from the ASA National Office. He is the greatest softball historian of all time. He has written a couple of books on the great history of this game. You can still go to www.softball.org and order them. The first one is the "Softball's Hall of Famer" book and it chronicles the history of the ASA National Softball of Fame in Oklahoma City and has a bio on all the inductees. The second book is called " The Game America Plays: Celebrating 75 years of the Amateur Softball Association " Bill worked on this book for a long time and it commemorates the ASA's 75th Anniversary through historical photographs and personal stories. Relive the greatest moments in softball history with this engaging narrative of America's favorite participation sport. With never-before-published photographs and vignettes from players\, umpires\, and coaches\, this is a must-read for every player\, coach and fan of softball. Bill was most deservingly inducted into the ASA Hall of Fame in 1999. This man knows more about Softball History than any man alive in the United States today. He has helped me many times over with information on this site and I want to take the time to thank him for all he's done for me. Click on the Banners below to go to the ASA's "Inside Pitch" newsletter and also the "Ball and Strikes" Publication. Here is the link to the ASA online Article Bill Plummer did on me and my site: (Go to Page-5) Online Article about this Softball History Web Site   Check out the official Softball Magazine Web Site . This is the BEST and most informative Softball magazine in the country today. They have stories and statistics on many of the nation's invitational and national tournaments. Click on the link provided to read about this great publication from Gene Smith and Luann Madison. I used to write a monthly article for these nice people and it was called "Softfacts". Click on the links above to go to their special features " Bat Wars " and " Softball Central ".  Check out the official Softball Today Web Site . This is another great softball magazine that always has informative articles on what's going on in the world of softball. Click on the link provided to read about this publication. Every single publication gets better then the last one as they have been including more and more tournament information from across the country. Plus they have their annual equipment guide that is second to none.  Take a look at the web site that Gordie Heagle has put together. Gordie was a close friend of Jerome Earnest and is making an effort to continue what Jerome started on the internet by covering the major softball events. The Old Scout's Web Site will have up to date information\, rankings\, schedules\, statistical leaders and everything else that is good for the game. Gordie also retired last fall and no longer is involved in the great game he loved and promoted. His web site is still up and of course the most looked at " Softball Message Board " in the country.  Check out Mike Macenko's House of Swing . This man is the greatest softball player that ever lived and has been inducted in all four Softball Association's Hall of Fames. He is a true living legend in the sport and gives a lot of his time to making the game better. The site is oaded with great information about the past and present. Complete with articles and photos spanning at least four decades.   Check out the Kendrick Brothers Jason and Nathan's web page Big League Softball . Jason Kendrick is one of the all time greats of this game and probably has won more outstanding defensive player awards than anybody in history. He is a class act. His brother Nathan is one of the nicest people I have ever spoken to. Together\, they have a great thing going. They have an assortment of softball stuff on their site ranging from Instructional videos to Actual game videos to Softball Apparel. Jason currently is a Rep for Combat Softball and Nathan is the CEO of the World Softball League  Check out what a guy named Mark Linnemann had to say about this web site. Mark is a well respected owner and writer of the Cincinnati Softball News Publication as well as the Head Chairmen of the Hudepohl Softball Hall of Fame which encompasses the Greater Cincinnati area including Northern Kentucky. If you're interested in getting a subscription\, contact him at 859-341-7088 or email him at the link provided. Here is the nice Article he wrote on my site. Thank You Mark  This is one of the more popular Web Sites and Message Boards on the East Coast. Rick Lilly of Angle Inn fame runs this site and it is always filled with so much informative stuff. And the message board always is always 'interesting' as it's title states; Softball Show Smack Talk.  These are three other great sites to go to. Softball Kingdom and Softball Center are both Nationally based and follow the big tournaments. Softball Fans has one of the most popular message boards in the country and also the best bat reviews around. When speaking about Slow Pitch Softball History\, a familiar name comes to mind\, Jerome Earnest . Without him\, there wasn't much softball history\, because he documented a lot of it. He was instrumental in getting the many softball publications to the point that they are today. Way back when\, the ASA and USSSA both had their own papers and reported on their own information. Jerome took this idea and ran with it. He reported on all Slow Pitch information with equal emphasis put on all organizations and events. The help he gave me was immeasurable in starting up this site. Before going to the Jerome Earnest's Supreme Softball Site \, stop by and visit the page I put together in his honor. It chronicles his life and explains why he was so respected in the softball world. The link doesn't take you to the Supreme Softball Site\, that site is no longer\, but the link does capture a little of what Jerome was all about. It is a snapshot of what he did back in the 1999-2000 time frame. What he did was unbelievable dedication and hard work.  Kevin Cherkas has a site that is talked about all around the east coast. He is a good friend\, a good ball player and an even better person. His message board is sometimes controversial due to the fact he lets people "tell it like it is". But he is a good family man and will not tolerate any stuff on there that he deems "not in the best interest of the game" The Big Boy Softball Message Board is a great site for east coast tournaments and information especially in and around my home state of Pennsylvania.  Inspiration for this page was instilled to me at a young age when I was growing up in Long Island and a man I greatly admire played with and against some of these legends of the game. The sparkle that comes to his eyes to this day as he reminisces about those days only go to show what this great game of softball is all about. Thank you Mister D or as I call him\, Dad. I also want to say thanks to My Family for their support also. Being as I am from Norristown\, Pennsylvania\, I have separate history sections for the ASA of PA Softball History and Norristown Area Softball History for those interested.In closing\, I'd like to thank every single softball person (present and past) that has taken the time to talk to me or send me information to help make this page as complete as it can be.

The man that was hired to be the head coach of the Florida Gators nearly four years ago could no longer cut it as the leader of the orange and blue footballers. It was sad at times to see our once great program fall to the depths of a 4-8 season and follow that up with a team that couldnt finish close games. Along the way\, we seemed to know one thingthat Muschamps tenure at the University of Florida was quickly coming to a close and there was little chance there would be a year five. Im not disappointed that Muschamp wont return. We have to be honest with ourselves in saying that the Gators werent cutting it over the last two calendar years. Many only had good things to say about Muschamp the person once his firing (oh\, sorry\, he resigned) was announced. Thats all good and well\, but it doesnt detract from the fact that he wasnt winning football games. Even Ron Zook went 16-8 in the SEC. Muschamp served up a paltry 17-15 conference record. Thats right; in eight more SEC games\, Muschamp only managed one more conference win than Zook. But lets not harp on the latest former head coachMuschamp will get paid handsomely to coordinate a defense and will eventually be asked to be a head coach again. I wish him well\, but at the same time I am excited to see what the next era in Florida Gators football brings. That era began on December 4\, 2014 with the announcement that former Alabama offensive coordinator and Colorado State head coach Jim McElwain would lead the Gators into the future. Many of you immediately yelled (or\, more accurately\, tweeted) COLORADO STATE?!? Im forced to remind you where we found Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer. We had forgotten McElwain\, he of Bama lore. He had gone to the Rams and turned around a team while we had turned our focus back to the SEC. His three-year progression from 4-8 to 8-6 to 10-2 is impressive. Even more so when you consider Zook and Muschamp HAD NEVER BEEN HEAD COACHES!!! Hes not the sexy name\, but who is these days? Nick Saban? Yeah\, never going to happen. Chip Kelly? Really not a possibility. Bringing Spurrier back? The guy is now 69 years old. McElwain\, for the record is 52\, or 17 years younger than the man at South Carolina. (Side note: McElwain is 17 years old than I am. Thats some weird Bermuda triangle right there.) Hes an offensive coach. Check. Hes a good recruiter. Check (although so many of them are these days). High school coaches like him. Check. Former and current players rave about him. Check. A lot of people a whole lot smarter and more connected than I am like the hire. Check. Hes not Lane Kiffin. Check. We have a little bit of a project on our hands\, but we also did on December 31\, 1989 when Spurrier was announced as the next head coach of the Gators. Spurrier was given a pass from the critics because 1) Twitter didnt exist\, and 2) if his Wikipedia page is correct\, he won a Heisman Trophy as a quarterback at the University of Florida. But here was Spurriers record in three years at Duke: 20-13-1. Hes McElwains in three years at CSU: 22-16. Spurrier won 59% of his college-coached games before coming to Florida; McElwain won 58% of his. Im not saying McElwain will be Floridas savior. How could I possibly know that? How could anyone? But on paper (and the Internet)\, he looks like a good candidate and one that wemyself includedshouldnt have overlooked. He could be great\, he could fall flat on his face\, but both of those are true of anyone that would have been named the next head coach. (REMINDER THAT SABAN AND KELLY WERENT COMING!) Its about two months until Ill receive my notice for season ticket renewal. Ill be honest again (Im never not) and say that I would have renewed regardless. Muschamp\, McElwain\, whoeverI would still be a season ticket holder in 2015. I enjoy it despite the fact that there havent been a whole lot of wins Ive seen in person since becoming one\, but having season tickets to Florida Gators football pleases me. Barring unforeseen circumstances\, Ill have them for a long time. Id like more wins\, of course\, but Ill go through the painful times as well. Call me what you want for having that philosophy\, but its my choice and will be for many years to come. So here we are Florida fans. We have a bowl game and 60 minutes of D.J. Durkin the head coach. Then we have months and months and months of watching McElwain build his Gators. The 2015 season cant get here soon enough.

Each time\, Ive starred at my laptops screen wondering what would come out of my head and onto the paper. And each time\, the result was the samenothing. No words\, no thoughts\, nothing to say. Just a blank document looking right back at me wondering what to make of the Florida Gators football team as much as I am. Today was a different day. Any other season\, it was would have been a day of hope. A day during the week leading up to the Georgia game and a rivalry renewed for another season. As our venerable friend Lee Corso would say\, not so fast. Im not excited. Im actually as close to the exact opposite as any one person can get. In effect\, my perpetually half full glass of hope has spilled all over my desk\, ruining my keyboard and destroying my just-win attitude in the process. Im a forlorn Florida fan of the worst kind. Let me say that losses happen. They happen in a variety of ways. They happen against an Alabama team that at this moment in college football history is superior in every way. They happen in a wild few minutes against LSU where a win was within reach a number of times before it suddenly wasnt. But theyre not supposed to happen the way they happened against Missouri. The Gators managed to lose a game during which they allowed just 119 yards of offense to the Tigers. And not only did Florida lose\, they lost by 29 points. Theres getting kicked in the stomach and then theres getting kicked in the stomach\, sucker punched in the back of the head\, drug into the alley\, and thrown in a dumpster. That gamegame six of the season I remind youleft far too many questions. The first of which is where exactly are the Gators improving? Florida should have done what it did to Eastern Michigan. It was fun to watch and\, despite the opponent\, raised our hope level a couple of notches. Then came Kentucky and an overtime thriller. But these Wildcats may have more fight in them than the Wildcats of old\, so we can come up with enough excuses to accept the outcome. And\, hey\, a win is a win. Right? RIGHT??? Alabama is\, well\, Alabama. All hail thee Nick Saban. The Tennessee game brought another win-is-a-win feeling even as concerns mounted. Then back to The Swamp and LSU. A catch is made and were looking at 4-1. Issues aside\, thats 4-1 with one loss to the mighty Tide. I could have accepted that and continued to be my happy-go-lucky self. Glass half full I tell you. But that catch didnt happen. Things turned. The Tigers won and then a different set of striped beasts pushed us down the stairs we were playing too close to in the first place. 10 days later and the Gators are still stumbling down those steps\, the bottom nowhere in sight. Theres talk of a new coach before Will Muschamp is even given the notice to clear out his office. There are looks to an old friend or two\, new hot options\, and even the NFL. Where no one is looking is at Muschamp himself. With five games left\, were looking to 2015 and a new leader. Let me say that again\, with five games left it appears that Gator Nation has given up hope on the 2014 season and on Muschamp and has moved on. Thats sad on many levels\, but it has come to that. Is it justified? In the eyes of some\, yes. In the eyes of others\, maybe not. But one thing is very clear\, there are glaring issues that need to be fixed lest our beloved Gators fall further down the college football ladder. In two days\, the Gators will head to Jacksonville for the Worlds Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party and a less-than-favorable matchup against the Georgia Bulldogs. Yes\, Im still calling it the Worlds Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party. Yes\, the Bulldogs are favored and should be. I dont have my usual hope at the moment. Ive searched high and low for it\, but its nowhere to be found. Maybe it made the road trip to Jacksonville. That would be goodmy hope there in the stands\, wearing orange and blue\, cheering on the Gators. I doubt it though. In reality\, its probably hiding under my bed or in the woods behind my house waiting for the right moment to return. If were being realistic (which we obviously are\, because I just said in reality)\, then that moment isnt just around the corner. There are coaching holes and execution holes and scoring-more-points-than-the-other-guys holes. My love of the Florida Gators hasnt diminished\, but my hope for the remainder of the 2014 football schedule may have. Itll be there in spurts as we continue our approach toward Saturday. There will be moments of why not?!? and posts of pictures of games past . There will be a #justwin here or there and more than a few To Hell with Georgias yelled out. This is a great game and a great rivalry and I wont let my melancholy ruin that. Then again\, you may want to steer clear of me for the first few hours after the game depending on the outcome. I can only handle so much. So we go into the final stretch. No more rain outs and no more bye weeks. Instead\, five consecutive November gamestwo against hated rivals\, one against a rival we cant quite decide if we want to call a rival or not\, another against an SEC East opponent that embarrassed every fiber of our being one season ago\, and Eastern Kentucky. (If 2014 Eastern Kentucky becomes 2013 Georgia Southern\, Ill have a hard time watching another minute of college football this season.) I feel a dash of hope just writing this\, despite its reached-a-point-of-no-return overtones. Its the wait\, is the glass really half empty? part of me. At the moment\, I feel like it is indeed. Heres to praying the next 48 hours bring me back to life. Tagged College Football \, Florida Gators \, Georgia Bulldogs \, SEC \, Will Muschamp 65 Reasons to Be Happy\, If Even for a Moment  By The Bull Gator | September 8\, 2014 - 4:32 pm | Florida Gators Football 4 Comments 65-0 should be enough. For me\, it is. I woke up Sunday morningone day after our beloved Florida Gators dismantled Eastern Michiganand took to Twitter. There was plenty of positivity in Gator Nation and\, for the most part\, fans were happy. But there were still the few. Those that have to find the flaw in the win. Those that may finally be happy at an undefeated season and a national championship. Those that may never be pleased. Thats their right. Every fan has that right. Cheer when you want; critique when you feel the need. The type of fan a person chooses to be is a choice they stand by and Im not here to tell them theyre wrong. All Im here to do is to say that Im happy and that happiness will last for more than just one moment. EMU was far from an SEC opponent. They were not a world-class team. The Gators should have beaten them 65-0. But heres the thing: one season ago\, Florida didnt beat the teams they were supposed to beat. The Gators lost to Georgia Southern at home. Go back one season further and you find a narrow win over Louisiana. Lately\, Florida hasnt been taking care of business against the teams theyre heavily favored against. Saturday was different; be happy. To start\, we saw football. The game wasnt delayed. There wasnt one play hours after the scheduled kickoff. There wasnt a postponement that turned into a cancellation. Instead\, there was football. Good football at that. For 60 minutes\, it felt like the orange and blue channeled the teams of old. 65 points\, 655 yards\, and big plays. Oh those big plays. I grew up in the PlayStation generation. Video game offenses didnt exist in real life\, but they could get close. Steve Spurrier kept scoring. The brakes were never applied. That was Saturday. When your backup quarterbacka true freshman making his first appearance in The Swamp at thatgoes deep on his first pass attempt (AND COMPLETES IT FOR A 70-YARD TOUCHDOWN!!!) you arent letting up. Lets stop there for a second and look at Treon Harriss line: 2 completions\, 2 pass attempts\, 148 passing yards\, 2 passing touchdowns\, 1\,051.6 rating. Read that last stat again. The highest rating a college quarterback can possibly achieve is 1\,261.6. To do so\, he would have to have every pass attempt result in a 99-yard touchdown completion. Harris was darn close. Yes\, I know it was against a team without a great defense and he was doing so late in a blowout\, but those facts do little to diminish what was a great first showing by the freshman. We may have ourselves quite the backup quarterback. There were plenty of more good performances in the win. Jeff Driskel was solid and looked calm in Kurt Ropers offense. The running game accounted for 259 yards on the ground and the trio of Kelvin Taylor\, Matt Jones\, and Mack Brown averaged 8.7 yards per carry. Demarcus Robinson had 5 catches for 23 yards his freshman season; he had 6 for 123 and a touchdown on Saturday. Clay Burton led the team with 7 catches\, more than doubling his career total of 3 going into the game. Andre Debose looked like the player we thought he could be all those years ago. Duke Dawson had quite the debut. Brian Poole was everywhere on defense. And the entire defense was smothering. Like I said\, Im happy. Many will call this a warm-up game\, and they would be correct in doing so. The Gators were supposed to get two warm-up games. Lightning wiped that plan away. Now\, Florida will head to SEC play with one game and a big win under its belt. Kentucky has not looked like the Kentucky of old and could present a challenge\, but I will gladly accept that challenge after Saturdays showing. There are many worse ways to go into your first SEC game. The Gators will be favored\, and rightfully so\, but we may not completely know what we have just yet. An explosive offense\, check. A shutdown defense\, check. Capable special teams\, check. All looked good on Saturday and thats enough to keep me positive\, so for now I will be. In one game\, the Gators answered as many questions as a team could in only 60 minutes. There are 10 games to go\, though\, and Florida will be questioned going into every one. Thats fine and perfectly acceptable\, but all I ask is that you try to keep that positive outlook. Im not sure if cheering for a team is all that much fun if you go into a game seeking gloom and doom. Call it naivet\, but I enjoy hope and Ill keep that hope going a little longer after the 65-0 win. As for Kentucky\, theres a win streak to keep alive. Weve seen some of those fall recently and would like the bleeding to stop. Lets keep the Kentucky streak alive and in a few weeks extend the Tennessee streak. The Gators may not be a championship-caliber team yet\, but they need to win the ones they should. Fall against the Wildcats and progress may be a dream at the moment. Handle their business against Kentucky and go into the Alabama game with two impressive wins and were headed in the right direction. All in all\, just win. Win more then you lose. Dont go 4-8. Becoming the orange and blue we all know they can be. Its hard to imagine that after just another 60 minutes\, well be a quarter of the way through the season. AH! MAKE IT SLOW DOWN! We were shorted a game and now that the season has started\, its going ahead full force. 10 games to go\, each one counts\, blah\, blah\, blah. I could hype it up one hundred different ways. You dont need me to get you hyped for the first SEC game. You know the importance. Go Gators! And again\, Just Win!

And this one is no different. Years ago\, when the first sports blogs appeared\, the idea was simple: sports\, from a fans perspective. You visited because you were intrigued and you returned because it felt like you were reading the thoughts of someone you could hang out with. Suddenly\, your friends had a voice. Sports blogs were different than traditional sports journalism because of that voice. You didnt see dry game recaps. No\, you saw opinions. Opinions you yourself had or even those you vehemently disagreed with. But it was those opinions you latched on to and wanted more of. You wanted your rant to your dog after a heartbreaking defeat to be justified because someone out there somewhere felt the same way you did. It was a beautiful thing. Then they became too popular. Advertising. Networks. Partnerships. Sports blogs became the same large media outlets they had hoped to differentiate themselves from. Bloggers started to alter their writing styles to gain hits. They changed what they were writing about to drive page views. Opinions were still there\, but they were lost in a sea of 100-word game recaps with post titles carefully constructed for SEO purposes. During that time\, many sports blogs became insanely successful and just as many bloggers made careers out of what was first a hobby. Lets clear the air and say that not long after its inception in 2008 my goal was much the same with The Bull Gator. I wanted to be the next casual blogger turned buyout success. I too had lost sight of the reason I started TBG in the first place. But back to that in a moment. None of this is a knock on those high-trafficked blogs and what they have become\, even if its hard to call them blogs at this point. There are many of them I read weekly if not daily. My list of favorite writers includes a number of talented individuals that started as I did. They put in a lot of hard work to get where they are today and Im genuinely happy for them. They have turned a hobby into something much more. There was a time when I wanted the same\, but now Im not so sure. The point of all of this is to return to the reason I started TBG in the first placebecause Im a fan of sports\, specifically college football and the Florida Gators. I and a group of friends would banter over emails chains that lasted days. We loved every aspect of college football and probably liked discussing it even more. We were simply fans\, and then I started TBG. TBG was an outlet for me to expand on my opinions. One of those friends once said you should start a blog\, so I did. How many endeavors in the history of the world have begun that way? You should see whats across that ocean? You should make a rocket that will take people to the moon? You should definitely take that shot? Okay\, that last one is almost always a bad idea\, especially if its after 2:00am. So I went to Blogger\, signed up\, and TBG was born. It took a long time to find its focus and even today may not truly have one. I tried talking any and all sports. I tried focusing on the athletic programs of the two universities I had the pleasure of attending. I tried just one of those schools. I tried to be too much. I tried to be too little. Mostly\, I tried. I wouldnt say I failed\, but I tried a lot that worked out and just as much that didnt. For the last few months\, as TBG lay idle\, Ive thought about what its future held. More often than not\, those thoughts came around to shutting it down and saying farewell to the world of blogging\, but in the end thats not what I really wanted. What I wanted was to be a fan again. I wanted to share my opinions on the Gators. I didnt want to rush to write a game recap as quickly as I could as soon as the final buzzer sounded. I wanted to write what I wanted to write when I wanted to write it. I wanted to go to games thinking about my love of the orange and blue\, not worrying about how long it would be before I could get up a post about the latest injury\, or highlight\, or win\, or loss. I wanted to be what I was in 2008 when I clicked the button that made the site live. So today\, Im a fan again. A Gators fan. A fan that is seriously concerned over his choice of shirt and hat for the first game because superstition has set in. A fan that cant wait to go to the bookstore and add to my all-too-large collection of Florida apparel. A fan that hopes with everything in his being that 4-8 was an anomaly we wont see again. A fan that cheers during the good times and the bad times. A fan that spills his beer jumping out of his seat after a touchdown. A fan that paces in front of the television when the Gators are losing. A fan that truly believes it when he says wait til next year. A fan. I love the Gators in every way a diehard does. Im angry at 4-8. Im happy at the prospect of improvement. I experience the ups and downs of recruiting. I think Will Muschamp should be fired while at the same time think he needs more time. I blame injuries. I blame refs. I blame offensive coordinators. I blame myself for putting on a cursed shirt. I believe I can impact a game by yelling at the players from the comfort of my living room (my wife disagrees). As that fan that I am once again becoming\, I could not be more nervous about the upcoming season. 4-8. 4-8!!!!! Its hard to think it let alone say it. There were so many factors that went into that record and so many excuses we could make for it\, but it doesnt change the fact that the Gators went 4-8 in 2013 and lost to Georgia Southern AT HOME! No\, no\, just no. I hardly had the energy to give out my signature line of just win last season because more often than not Florida couldnt. To make matters worse\, they started 4-1. Thats a whole lot of losing to end a season. I wasnt a happy fan and if Twitter\, Facebook\, the Internet in general told the story\, none of you were either. But 2014 is a new season and with it comes a new offensive coordinator. Hope springs eternal in the life of a sports fan. The problem is that we hope for something along the lines of 10-2 when realistically 7-5 could signal a drastic improvement. And there is exactly where fans will divide. We could see a dramatically improved Florida team that does go 7-5. There will be the fans that seen that improvement and look toward 2015 and on the other side will be those fans that see 7-5 and dont care what the Gators looked like to get there. To them the five losses are far too many\, and theyre right. That is too many losses. So is four\, but Ive always looked at it in terms of wins. For me\, 10 wins is the mark. Thats what a program like Florida should hit season after season after season. The Gators play in an unbelievably competitive conference\, you all know that\, but based on so many other factors\, they should be near the top of the SEC every single season. I want 10 wins\, at least. I want it in 2014 even if I dont think its realistic. I want it so my friends that like those other schools that will remain nameless shut up. And I want it so Im happy. But mostly\, for 2014\, I want improvement. I want visible improvement to show the program is rebuilding and getting back to where it should be. And I think it will happen. I do. Of my group of Florida fan friends\, Im the most optimistic one. Its a fault\, but also keeps me sane. I think. The glass is more than half full for me and I like it that way. 4-8 is behind us and all signs point to improvement in 2014. But again\, that improvement may not show much in the final record. Maybe I just want to see good football. There were times\, many times\, last season where good football wasnt present. There was a lot of bad\, horrible\, awful football. I cant stomach even the thought of the loss to Vanderbilt. I was there that day watching who knows what. It was not good football and probably the farthest from it the Gators have played in quite some time. That leads me to the bright spots. A healthy Jeff Driskel should fit into Kurt Ropers offense. Vernon Hargreaves III is one of the nations best players. Dante Fowler\, Jr. is a superstar in the making and someone we will be watching on Sundays for a very long time. And the running back position excites me as long as injuries and the fumble bug dont hit. I like a lot about this team. I dont believe its a championship team and I dont think anyone else does\, but if you look hard enough\, turn your head to the left\, squint\, and tap your heels together three times\, you might see that Florida is putting something together. The first three games on the schedule could tell us nothing. September 20 will. A trip to Alabama that all too many have written off as a loss already. Im not proclaiming a Gators win. I just want to see what happens. It will be a telling 60 minutes during which well see where this team is and where they will go. Add LSU\, Missouri\, Georgia\, South Carolina\, and FSU to the schedule and\, wellscariest environment imaginable. And I didnt even mention Tennessee and Vanderbilt. Hence the 7-5 would be a drastic improvement comments. Regardless of what will or wont happen and my hope or lack thereof\, Im excited. Today is the most wonderful day of the year (you know\, every day I get to spend with my wife and son aside). Its the start of the college football season. I have a Gators shirt on\, I set up a patio television for my pool viewing pleasure (its hot in Florida this time of year\, people)\, and in a few hours I pick up my cousin at the airport. That last part is important because my cousin may be the biggest Gators fan that has ever lived that has stepped on the University of Florida campus exactly once. The two of us will be at the game on Saturday\, so if you see two men tailgating behind a black GMC Yukon that look too old to be college students\, but too young to be true Bull Gators\, stop by\, say hello\, and join us for a beer. My name is Joel\, his name is Scott\, and were Florida Gators fans. Well cheer with the rest of you on Saturday and on every other Saturday for the next few months. Well be obnoxious to opposing fans when the moment calls for it. Well question every play that results in less than five yards. Well complain and moan if Roper doesnt rain down offensive fireworks galore from the very first snap. Through it all\, well cheer and we wont stop. Were fans of the orange and blue and excited to kick off another season with hope. And before I go\, I have to leave you with two thingsGo Gators! And Just Win!

College football fueled my desire to start this site way back when on March 19\, 2008. But\, in the words of everyones beloved grandpa Lee Corso\, not so fast. The first article posted to The Bull Gator was about college basketball. Okay\, okay. That is not entirely correct; the first post was a welcome to the site that three people readme\, the affectionately-named One Eyed Willy\, and my mom. But the first post of any substance was about college basketball. (Do not go back and read it; it is not very good.) In my mind\, the most wonderful time of the year is and always will be college football season. A 4-8 record cannot stop me from believing that. There is a second place though and a good one at that. March Madness\, the Big Dance\, the NCAA Tourney\, whatever you want to call it is great. For coaches\, for players\, for fans\, for companies hoping to market the heck out of themselves\, for sports in general\, college basketball tourney time is a truly glorious time of the year. It can (and does) get even better. When you are a fan of the nations No. 1 team\, it is oh so much better. I will not be shy about that fact and at times will even become boastful over the next few weeks\, assuming our top-ranked Florida Gators continue what has been a most wonderful stretch of victories. When your team makes the tourney\, you are pleased. When they make a run\, you are over the moon. When they enter as the prohibitive favorite to win it all\, well\, like the Grinchs heart that day\, your chest grows three sizes. If I played fantasy basketball \, I would bet on the Gators for much more than the fact that I am a fan. There is an obstacle between the Gators and the NCAA Tournament\, sort of. Florida must first make their way through the SEC Tournament. A conference tournament championship will only solidify the Gators claim to the top overall seed\, but it is far from necessary. We all would like Florida to carry momentum in to the bigger of the two tourneys\, but a loss would not be the end of the world. Wait\, forget I said that. Too many times in the past we have justified losses. Let us go ahead and stop that now. Yes\, it is true a loss in the SEC Tournament would not destroy all hope of a Gators national championship\, but it is also true that momentum can be a valuable commodity. Florida can go ahead and make it easy on everyone involved if they take care of business over the next three days and go in to the NCAA tourney with three more wins under their belt. Beat Missouri on Friday\, take down the winner of South Carolina-Tennessee on Saturday\, and win it all on Sunday. That is all the Gators have to do. Get three more wins out of the way and move on to the next prize. Seems simple enough\, and there is that pride creeping up. Expect it to be here for a while; it does not go away. First things first\, beat Mizzou. As always\, Go Gators!

Thanks for visiting HoyaSaxa.com . This is the site where you will find more news and information than you'll probably ever need to know about Georgetown University men's basketball. If you're looking for the official athletics site instead\, click here.  Wednesday Update 5/27/15 Last month\, Georgetown officials announced a design contest for the floor at Verizon Center. A sample of entries is found at GUHoyas.com --check it out. NBA Free Agent Tryouts 5/27/15 Recent graduate Jabril Trawick (C'15) is featured in a review of free agents practicing with the NBA's Indiana Pacers\, reads an article at NBA.com . "Trawick possesses great size for a guard\, measuring out at 6-4 and 218 pounds\," reads the article. "In addition to his strong frame\, Trawick showed marked improvement as a jump shooter in his final college season\, improving his 3-point percentage from .312 as a junior to .407 as a senior." Also in the Pacers camp: Greg Whittington\, the former Georgetown forward who disappeared from the sports pages after his dismissal from the team in the fall of 2012. "It means a lot\," Whittington said of the invite. "It means that these two years I've been working hard and now my chance is right here\, time to take it." Georgetown Limits "Cost Of Attendance" Aid 5/26/15 Over 100 Georgetown students receive athletic scholarship support each year. But in the wake of an new NCAA rule\, the University will offer additional support to just 28 of them. At issue is the " cost of attendance " scholarship\, which allows Division I schools the ability to provide an amount beyond room\, board\, books and tuition\, to include such costs as academic supplies\, transportation and laundry\, among others. The rule is effective in the 2015-16 academic year. Friday's Washington Post reported that while Virginia and Maryland have committed to cost of attendance for all scholarship athletes\, Georgetown has opted only to award this to men's and women's basketball players. "As college athletics has gone through this reformation period over the last several years\, Georgetown has said all along that we would remain competitive nationally as we have throughout our rich history\," said athletic director Lee Reed in an e-mail to the Post. The total amount of additional aid is reported at $72\,800 across the 28 men's and women's players under scholarship\, or $2\,600 per person. "This is a great natural experiment\," said economist Andy Schwarz."Were getting to see change in an economic environment and see how firms react. Were learning a ton about the real preferences of schools with where they decide to put their money." A-Rod Tours Georgetown Campus 5/20/15 In the social media era\, it's almost impossible for a public figure to go on a campus tour\, and such was the case when New York Yankees infielder Alex Rodriguez visited Georgetown Tuesday. Rodriguez's visit wasn't merely a photo-op\, however. "He was very inquisitive not only about athletics\, but about the academic challenges in Georgetown: what its like to live here\, what its like to go to school here\, said Assistant Athletics Director Mex Carey to the Washington Post . "The fact that a guy of his stature would take time out of his day to tour a campus\, I was impressed. It was a really cool experience." An extended look at Rodriguez and his interest in visiting colleges is found in this link to ESPN.com . Rodriguez\, 39\, was recruited in two sports at the University of Miami but turned down a scholarship to enter professional baseball in 1993. He later donated $3.9 million to Miami to renovate its baseball stadium \, which is now known as "Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field." "Free Agency" In College Basketball 5/20/15 With a record 700 transfers in college basketball for 2014-15\, many of them eligible in the next semester\, there's no downtime for college coaches\, reports Ben Standig at CSN Washington . "The way the last couple of years\, and definitely this year\, you have to make sure in the fall you don't use all your scholarships so you have some when free agency opens up\," head coach John Thompson III told Standig. "That's what it feels like\, free agency". Georgetown has one scholarship open for 2015-16 but it's not certain that it will choose to fill the open place on the roster\, or save it for 2016\, where Georgetown has two seniors graduating. "We're still involved with a few people\," Thompson said. "We'll see how it shakes out." Report: New Name Coming To Verizon Center? 5/18/15 Verizon Communications\, Inc. officials have given notice that it will not renew its naming rights for Washington's Verizon Center past 2018\, reports Sports Business Journal . However\, Verizon officials have refuted the account\, saying they have not decided whether to renew when the agreement comes up on 2018\, reports the Washington Post . The downtown arena\, which assumed its present title when Verizon acquired MCI Inc. in 2006\, will seek a new naming rights deal of $7 million annually\, though the article said that it will face competition in the marketplace from Nationals Park\, which will also seek sponsorship. The only other major arena in the Washington DC area\, Patriot Center\, was renamed EagleBank Arena last month as part of a 10 year\, $6.6 million deal.

Bicycle Tours in Italy  The monument to Tullio Campagnolo at the Croce d'Aune pass. It was on this pass that he thought up the quick release as a result of difficulties that he had on a race here.  "I remember the first time I saw the Campagnolo monument. It was about two weeks after the 9/11 tragedy. We climbed the Croce d'Aune in September fog\, our voices strangely muffled. It was a beautiful and eery experience. The monument\, shrouded in mist\, was spectacular. We ate in a nearby restaurant\, famished from the long climb. As we sat there\, several of the locals in the restaurant gathered around us. They had little english and we had little Italian. However\, they put their arms on us and repeated with emotion\, 'so sorry\, so sorry'. I love the Italians." -Weaver Lilley The Italian Cycling Center offers an inexpensive and flexible European bicycling vacation for tourists and fitness riders. Our daily rides\, at different ability levels\, accommodate couples and groups who cycle at different paces\, or who have different expectations from cycling. A different concept- Rather than travel from town to town\, with the inconvenience of daily packing and moving\, we operate from a base located in an area with exceptional cycling. We dont concentrate on wine tasting\, expensive epicurean meals\, and luxurious lodgings\, rather we focus on providing cycling that is appropriate for each riders abilities and interests. Our cycling is challenging and our prices are moderate\, not the other way around. By keeping marketing expenses minimal and locating away from crowded tourist destinations\, we are able to provide comfortable accommodations and outstanding meals at a lower cost than most European cycling tours. Climate- Unlike in regions further south\, the nearby Alps keep the summers from being uncomfortably hot. Daytime temperatures range from 60 to 85 (15 to 29 C). There is little rainfall from mid-June to mid-September. July and August have the best conditions for cycling\, with clear blue skies and the least traffic on the roads. Non-cycling companions are welcome and can have a fulfilling vacation enjoying various activities. By participating in the daily rides as a passenger on the camp scooter\, a non-cyclist can see and enjoy the spectacular countryside\, challenging climbs\, and works of art that the cyclists enjoy. Other non-cycling activities include: touring the historic cities of Venice and Padua (both an hour away by train)\, swimming\, hiking in the mountains\, rock climbing\, parasailing (bring your license)\, horseback riding\, golf\, viewing great art in its original setting\, or just reading and relaxing in the clean mountain air. The rides usually finish shortly after one oclock\, so the afternoons are free for shared activities. A popular afternoon activity with both cyclists and non-cyclists is an afternoon hands-on working session in the kitchen with Angela \, our chef\, learning to make gnocchi and other Italian specialties. The new spa is a wonderful way to relax after a demanding ride and is located nearby. More information . Flexibility- Schedule any length of stay\, for whatever dates you prefer\, May through September. Trip insurance is not necessary since prepayment is not required and no dates are ever canceled. If you wish to do additional travel\, during or after your stay\, you may store your bicycle and extra luggage at our facilities. The daily rate per person is 120 for double occupancy\, and 135 for single occupancy at the Residence. Add 15 to stay at our hotel. The fee includes the ride\, lodging\, and three exceptional meals (including wine and bottled water) at our hotels restaurant. There are no wine kitties or hidden charges. Rental bikes- Your rides will be safer and more enjoyable if you ride your own bike. However\, if you cannot take a bike to Italy\, good quality road bikes with compact or triple cranksets are available for rent from a local bike shop for 25 a day. Allow plenty of time to arrange for availability of the proper size on your dates. The bike shop will have your rental bike waiting in the bike room when you arrive. How to get there- Venice and Treviso have the closest airports to the Italian Cycling Center. Non-stop flights to Venice are offered from JFK and Atlanta by Delta\, and from Philadelphia by US Airways. Ryanair offers inexpensive flights from England to Treviso. We can arrange transportation to and from these airports at any time of day. To make a reservation see the Reservations page.

Broomball has been played in Canada since the early 1900's. The sport has come along way since the days of using straw brooms. Broomball is a sport that is played on ice just like hockey. Aside from some of the rules that is all the two games have in common. Broomball is played with shoes that are specifically designed for running on ice and a metal or wooden broom is used instead of a stick. Broomball players run on ice they do not skate or glide therefore players can get quite the aerobic workout. How can I join? Broomball is played in various locations throughout the Northwest Territories - If there isn't a league in your area and you would like to start one\, please contact the president of NWT Broomball Jan Vallillee at justjan529@theedge.ca for assistance YK Ladies Broomball - Tina Setter - nwtbroomball@gmail.com YK Mens Broomball - Curtis Debogorski - curty@northwestel.net YK Mixed Broomball - Val Pond - netmindr@theedge.ca Hay River Broomball - Kim Tybring -kimtybring@hotmail.com Fort Simpson - Mike Squirrel - Mike_Squirrel@gov.nt.ca Fort Providence - Tina Gargan - tinagargan@yahoo.ca Is there Broomball for kids?

Fantasy Money Leagues - Your Guide to Daily Fantasy Sports To be paid out in 2015 Home League Reviews DraftKings Fantasy Feud Football Baseball Golf Basketball Legality Fantasy Money League Basics A fantasy money league or daily fantasy sports website provides games (contests) for prizes or money. In order to join contests\, you need to create a profile and deposit funds via credit card or bank account. Once you have the transferred funds in your account\, you can select the contest in which you want to play. Number of entrants\, entry fees\, prize pools and length of the contest vary. On daily sports sites\, most contests cover one or two days of games. In NFL contests for example\, the majority of contests include the football games on Sunday and Monday Night Football. There are also contests that only cover the Thursday night game. There are thousands of contests with different criteria to choose from every day. Once you decide on the contest that interests you\, the fun starts. The first step is drafting your team. The draft is usually based on a salary cap. Each player is assigned a dollar amount and you have a total salary dollar amount to spend on your players. Once the contest starts\, your team must outscore other teams to win cold hard cash. There are thousands played each day and hundreds of thousands of players on the most popular money league sites. In 2013\, there were three NFL contests that made the 1st place prize winner a millionaire. There were a little over 2\,000 people in those contests. Entrants had a 1-in-2000 chance of becoming a millionaire. Best of all\, these daily fantasy leagues arent going anywhere; according to federal US law\, fantasy sports are completely legal. Read more on our Legality page . There are other types of money leagues that last all season long\, such as Yahoo Pro Leagues. In this traditional format\, you pay a one-time entry fee and the winners win a specified dollar amount at the end of the season. A typical league costs $20 with 10 teams\, and the winner takes home $100. Sound like a rip off? We think so. You will end up spending hours researching\, adjusting your roster\, and after two months of work\, you might win $100. If you calculate the return on your time\, it comes out being pennies on the hour. Sure\, there are some larger stakes\, niche fantasy leagues\, but the average player will never play in these leagues. Whats going to happen in the next 3-5 years? Currently\, the average fantasy player gets together with a group of friends\, and uses Yahoo Fantasy Sports or ESPN free interface. Money is collected and paid out offline by a commissioner who doesnt do any work at his job. We dont think these games are going away. Its too much fun to talk smack to your friends and hoist the $3 trophy at the end of the year. These leagues will always have a place in the world\, but the real future is in the daily contests. Millions are being paid out each week and hundreds of millions of dollars are being paid out each year. Think were exaggerating? In 2014\, DraftKings alone will pay out over $400\,000\,000 in winnings. Its already a $1 Billion dollar industry and continues to grow. We predict an exodus from free fantasy sports games to daily fantasy money leagues over the next few years. Our goal is to become the authority source of information\, reviews and strategy for you on your journey to making a ton of money doing what you love. Select a sport below to learn more about the top leagues with the best signup bonuses\, games and prize pools. We only cover the most trusted and proven leagues that have been paying out hundreds of millions over the past 5 years. Free Money League Picks Sign up for our weekly email.

The Hovian The Hovian Albion 1  2Derby August 11\, 2013 by The Hovian Not going to say much apart from its good to be back at Falmer and seeing old mates again for a beer on a football Saturday. Shit start on the pitch\, but far from panic stations as were still only 6 points from automatic promotion\, ok kids? Cheers Tags: Brighton & Hove Albion \, Derby County \, Football \, Football Championship Posted in Falmer Stadium \, Season 2013-14 | Leave a Comment  New Season Preoccupations August 2\, 2013 by The Hovian Its back\, the football season. Oscar Garcias squad are in Leeds tomorrow\, at the very start of a new campaign. I wont be there\, I am in the UK\, but I do have other preoccupations (see above). His name is Bowzer\, and hes already more fun than six awaydays together\, with free booze. Expect phots of him and your author in all kinds of tricks and sport scrapes\, but in old clothes\, his teeth are like a mini-Great Whites and my garbs are the mainstay of his puppy diet. I will\, work allowing\, be at Falmer next Saturday. Hoping for the same as last season up to the play-offs and something verrrry different afterwards\, if we do make them. I still havent digested the Palace fiasco to this day. Enjoy your season wherever you are.

Im reasonably happy with how things have panned out\, after missing such a horrible end to last season\, and the embarrassment of Poyets drawn out sacking\, it really feels like a new page has been turned in the Albion history book. Tony Bloom has come out of this a lot stronger in the eyes of most Stripes fans\, but what of the minence grise\, the shadowy figure of Paul Barber? The jury is still very much out for me\, and the more I learn about this guy\, the more I cant but think Garry Cook\, Manchester City . Enjoy 2013-14\, if youre an Albionite youve earned yourself a good season.

One of the most fascinating aspects\, and certainly least documented in the UK\, is Italian youth culture\, and the most enigmatic period of all  the 1980s and the Paninari . During the height of what we brits now call Thatcherism  young urban and suburban Italians were discovering Americana\, hedonism and high fashion. Starting out in a burger joint in Milan early in the decade\, the Paninaro phenomenon spread to the rest of Italy and beyond\, and eventually found its looks replicated on the football terraces of Merrie Olde Englande in the late 1980s. When I was in Genoa and Turin lately\, I tried tracking down the eponymous Bible of the original Paninari\, Paninaro. My pidgin Italian didnt cut it at all the independent bookstores and stalls I sought out there. So\, I had to turn to that love/hate internet phenomenon  good old eBay  to find some satisfaction. For a few Euros I picked up some original and dog-eared copies of Paninaro\, direct from sellers in Italy. Flicking through these is like looking at a postcard from youthful continental holidays in my schooldays. Tanned\, young and happy people\, dressed to the nines in Moncler\, Timberland\, Best Company\, and Stone Island. The 1980s were the best ten years in the history of the world\, and I miss them now\, I really do. Enjoy these scanned pages\, their like will not be seen again anytime soon. Ciao ragazzi.

Heres the best of the rest of my photos from Turin\, as promised. Ill be pretty quiet on here until April\, and then its seeing the end of the Championship season in\, and another game over in Italy\, Sampdoria v Fiorentina. I fancy Albion to sneak the last play-off place\, and Samp to stay in Serie A now they have master tactician and player puncher Delio Rossi in charge. Cheers.

Ive taken so many decent ones that itll take a few posts to do them justice. So\, without further ado\, heres the best from the highlight of the holiday  Sundays brilliant win by 10-man Sampdoria over Juventus. I bought two tickets for 50 Euros each in a local Listicket shop in central Turin. I wasnt at all chuffed about having to fork out this kind of money\, but it was a one-off\, and I know when I go to watch Samp again in Genoa the tickets will be half that. Watching Samp then tonk the greedy Juve bastards (its the club suits\, not the fans\, Im aiming at here BTW) was all the more sweeter\, and I got my moneys worth for that alone. Samp fans in fine voice pre-match We got a lift to Juventus Stadium off the head of Sampdoria TV\, a nice bloke called Matteo\, who read my column in StandAMF and wanted to interview me for the local Genoa-based Samp channel. We were a bit late arriving at the Football Ground Formerly Known as the Stadio delle Alpi \, so we only managed three or four questions to camera\, about the pros and cons of Italian v English football. I talked shite and Im guessing the interview wont see the light of day. Matteo bid us farewell and promised to email the edited-for-broadcast TV clip. Havent heard from him since! LOL Juves stadium is in a beautiful setting\, with the Alps\, rolling in the cold winter sun to the northwest\, as a breathtaking backdrop\, one of the most recognisable vistas in world football. They have a fully functional shopping mall beneath or beside (or inside) the stadium structure\, and its all very Modern Football. I was feeling a bit disappointed at this stage\, Juventus are more than a mere football club\, and their corporate stadium is the only one in Serie A currently owned by the club that plays in it. Some have to share\, like the two paupers in Genoa/Genova\, so like our game here at home no-one really has a chance against such wealth and ostentation. Or do they?? Taking our seats I was more than a little happy we were about 10 seats away from the hardcore Samp fans who made the trip over the hills of Liguria for this supposedly mis-match of Italian football extremes (you cant buy away tickets in Serie A as a foreigner). The quaint reinforced glass partitions could surely take a lot of abuse\, but any British hoolie worth his salt could scale them in a nanosecond. Im sure they have more security in place when Torino FC visit for the Derby della Mole . The upshot was you could watch in fascination\, like at a zoo  up close and personal  the antics of opposing fans at their best: when the teams are on the pitch. It was a real hoot\, and as I had to sit on my hands when Samp scored twice\, it was even harder to keep a straight face when the Samp fans were goading the locals\, and me  I was to them a Juve fan from the fact I was sat among the enemy. The Curva Sud (its not curved anymore) The stadium is ok\, big and bowl-like\, like St Marys on steroids. They say its an improvement on the delle Alpi\, as the running track is gone and its more English with the fans close to the pitch. But the Juve fans have piped music to help them sing\, and the Drughi Ultras behind the home goal are pretty muted  no flares\, smoke bombs and general mayhem like at the Marassi and other Serie A grounds. When Juve scored their stonewall penalty to take the lead\, the PA got in with a song before the bulk of the home fans could let out a roar. Shit\, utter shit\, my pet hate at any football match is de rigueur at the biggest club in Italy  fuck modern football. Juve were relaxed\, arrogant even\, and assured of victory once the hot-headed Berardi got a second yellow midway through the first half\, just after the penalty. Samp looked doomed\, and I predicted a 3 or 4 goal hammering. How wrong I was. They picked up a gear from somewhere and in the second half\, although they held on from some ferocious Juve assaults on goal\, two fantastic breakaway goals from the Argentinian teenager Icardi dispatched the Italian Champions\, and with clinical aplomb. The home fans went into silent shock\, while the sliver of blue/white/red/black to our right went mental. It was great\, and even though Ive watched live games in the wrong end quite a few times\, Ive never been so close to see goading like this  how the Blucerchiati enjoyed themselves. Another joy was to see fans favourite Angelo Palombo back in the team after being out in the cold for so long. The little guy played in central defence and would have got my Man of the Match if Icardi hadnt been so deadly. 1st half action We left elated as they kept the Samp fans in after the final whistle\, and to round it all off our taxi driver back into town was a diehard Torino fan\, so he was pretty happy to ferry us back into central Turin\, where we enjoyed watching the replays of Icardis goals before heading out for a steak and some beers. Awesome. Juve win & score a penalty\, nothing dodgy about it Ill get some pictures up of Turin later\, as its a very photogenic city\, with a lot to point a camera at. Cheers.

Ive taken loads of phots on both my normal camera and the iPhone\, so many I thought Id better start uploading them to here early doors; I know I wont be arsed when I get home. Picked the match tickets up for Juve v Samp yesterday\, and got seen off for 50 apiece\, remember tickets for Samp at home cost 21 each. Juventus are the biggest fish in Serie A\, so I guess we were always going to get charged more. The bastards. Expecting Samp to take a bit of a beating\, but with the new manager apparently happy to return the combative fans favourite Angelo Palombo to the playing field\, it might be a tighter game than predicted. Stay tuned for more updates.

It was great to be traipsing through the Christmas rain up to Falmer to see the stripes again. That is until the match actually started. I dont know whats happening with the team\, and yes Watford are a good side with another young football-as-it-should-be-played manager steering them\, but Gus Poyets side now have no fight in them it seems. Toothless up front\, slow to the point of being embarassing at the back (Bomber El-Abd needs a new nickname\, that was painful)\, and a midfield without the fantastic Liam Bridcutt doesnt bear thinking about. If Albion let him go this upcoming tranfer window\, as is rumoured\, then were fucked\, its as simple as that. So\, Man of the Match to the player I always have thought as the best we have  our midfield ball winner  Liam Bridcutt. And going into the North West corner However\, you dont need me to tell you that football is a harsh mistress\, and if you look at Brighton & Hove Albion over a 5 year timescale and not just this season\, weve come a long way\, and its still a huge success story. I do like the way the corners of the ground are getting filled in\, and in a way thats not going to turn the place into another soulless indentikit bowl\, I just wish we could fill the huge gaps in the footballing side at the minute. The Watford lot  noisy\, with a lot to be noisy about Happy New Year to you\, wherever you find yourself\, Im missing the Newcastle FA Cup game as\, guess what\, Ill be in Turin watching Juventus v Sampdoria on 6th January. Match/holiday report to follow soon after. Cheers.

The Bowl System Debate Bowls or Playoffs? The NCAA Football Debate "College basketball has the greatest postseason. But college football has the greatest season. That's because of the bowls." (John Branch\, " Debate is the Beauty of the Bowl Systems \," The Fresno Bee \, Nov. 25\, 2003) Opponents of the existing NCAA college football bowl system are generally unshakeable. The stalwart and unflinching nature of these convictions\, the intensity of the belief that nothing could possibly be better for a sport than a traditional\, decisive postseason winner-takes-all tournament system\, is noteworthy. No one argues with tournament results\, right\, so what could go wrong? The intensity and simplicity of their beliefs sometimes rivals that sometimes found in those believing they have proof of a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination . The annoying thing is not so much the belief that is proposed\, but the unwillingness of the public to dig deeper and seriously analyze the assumptions on which their beliefs in the superiority of a bowl or playoff system are founded. The question is\, after all\, one of grave importance to our sports-watching society. Most of the naivete\, though\, is on the sides of those calling for a playoff system. Many demonstrably wrong arguments are made in favor of a playoff system\, and playoff proponents do themselves no good to misunderstand the nature of their arguments. Here my hope is not to totally debunk the notion that a postseason tournament in NCAA football would have merits\, but I do hope to do apply the brakes to several of the fallacies that suggest that a playoff system would be a cure-all to all NCAA football problems. Myths About the Bowl System Myth: The result of a winner-takes-all tournament is the best measure of the merit of a team.  This point is driven by the notion that holding a winner-takes-all tournament gives us a better way of ranking teams than any other measure. However\, win a team wins a tournament\, it means two things: (1) the team qualified for the tourney\, and (2) the team did not lose a game during the tournament.  But often overlooked is that this might tell us relatively little. Tournaments sometimes have peculiar results. For instance\, suppose IU plays Purdue twice during the regular season\, and wins each contest\, has a better overall season\, and gets a better tournament seed than Purdue. Then suppose that the two teams meet in the tournament and Purdue wins the match. Is it truly a matter of "better merit" that Purdue would advance and IU would not\, in spite of IU winning two out of three against Purdue\, and having the better overall season? Not at all. Winner-takes-all tourney proponents are often quick to presume the regular season is irrelevant beyond serving as a qualifier to such a tournament. However\, there's no a priori reason to do this -- why not put more weight on the regular season results? Wouldn't that make the regular season games more interesting? (Note: If some reflex forced you to mentally answer "No\," there is probably a denial instinct at work.)  Further counter-examples:  (a) The winner of every top tennis tournament is not necessarily the #1 tennis player in the world.  (b) Flukes such as temporary injuries or personal tragedies might affect a team's performance in only one game of a tournament.  (c) Suppose\, for example\, that a team went undefeated during the regular season\, and defeated the team that eliminated them as well as every team that reached the final four. If you didn't know which games were tournament games and which are not\, it would appear that that eliminated team was the most meritorious team. In fact\, one alternative to a winner-takes-all tournament would be to simply calculate or poll the final rankings post-tournament; the tournament victor would not necessarily be ranked #1\, if other teams had superior seasons. Myth: College football needs a clear champion every year.  This notion itself is so fundamental to objections to the bowl system\, and yet it is not so strongly founded. Several get along well without annual championships. To list a few examples of this off the top of my head:  Some perfectly good sports that do not even have a clear annual championship:  (1) Pro boxing  (2) Pro golf.  (3) Pro tennis.  Some sports also have champions\, but not necessarily determined by tournament. Pro boxing is an example.  In reality\, "winner-takes-all" is not even necessarily the most accurate reflection of merit. For instance\, if two teams are evenly dominant and equally accomplished for one season\, a split title might be more reflective of the merits of the programs. A single-elimination tourney system forces one of the other to be regarded as the best. But the team that loses first\, might not lose two out of three; two teams that face each other might have an even win percentage against each other as more games are played. Tournament systems cannot reflect that\, as they always forcibly break down contests to win or lose; tying or sharing of credit is regarded as a strangely taboo occurrence among many fans\, but that is a subjectively imposed taste\, not an attempt to do justice to meritorious teams\, and it should not be confused as such. Myth: There are no clear champions under the bowl system\, but a tournament tells us clearly who the champion is.  Firstly\, there are distinct and clear champions under the bowl system: the poll and BCS winners. They play under those rules\, which are reasonable enough\, and they live and die by those rules; the rules lead to clearly determined (albeit controversial) results. The thing is that there is no single\, unanimous measure of championship . Instead\, under the system as we have it now\, there are basically two distinct kinds of championships.  (i) National championships\, as determined by rankings . These are crowned to those whom the press regards as having the most impressive season\, and also the team that the computer formulas and the coaches regard as having the most impressive season. No one can doubt that winning either of these (much less both) is a grand feat for a program. Winning unanimously\, all else equal\, is a better feat than winning both\, but winning either is a grand feat. There can be no mistaking this interpretation of these events\, although some will complain about the fact that one team or another played a great season and "didn't get the chance" at the championship. To this\, we can only say this: had the team played well enough to be clearly at the top by all measures\, they would have made it to at least the split title. Also\, if your season wasn't that impressive\, sorry\, you might have to settle for the Fiesta\, Rose\, or some other major bowl championship; it's not exactly tragic\, for crying out loud.  (ii) Bowl championships / invitations . A team can be\, say\, the "Rose Bowl champion." Anyone who follows college football will have an understanding that this implies the team had a meritorious season\, although not necessarily the kind of season that would make it the undisputed national champion.  The winner-takes-all tourney proponents suggest that the winner of the tournament is far more clear than the champion in national rankings. That is distinctly not true. The only thing that is different is that people basically agree to consciously quit debating about which team is the champion once the tournament begins. From there on\, the tourney proceeds\, and all but one team is eliminated\, and by the end of the tourney\, everyone else in the tournament has lost to either that team\, or to a team that lost to a team ... that lost to a team that lost to that team. That sports fans under a tournament system decide to quit debating on which team is most merit-worthy of the title "national champion" is evidence that people have shut up \, but is not necessarily evidence that their judgment is a more sensible\, rational measure of merit than a rankings-based system. This probably often occurs because the tourney proponents either (1) consciously will themselves to ignore everything but the tournament outcome\, thusly defining the rules of the game\, or (2) do not understand well enough how a team can win a tournament and still not be the most meritorious team overall for that season. See above. Myth: The current system is motivated by money\, and money is not a valid measure of whether bowls or playoffs would be better.  Money is generated only when people watch the game on TV or are willing to pay for tickets. Thus the system that generates the most money is the system that will tend to be the most watched\, and therefore the most interesting. Myth: Adding a tournament to a sport brings in a lot of revenue to the sport.  If that is so\, why\, for instance\, doesn't a sport like pro boxing implement a tournament system? Probably because the business model that leads some sports to hold tournaments\, is not a one-size-fits-all model. The tournament system might work fine in college basketball\, but in that sport\, we're talking about filling 20\,000 seats per game\, not up to 65\,000 or 100\,000. With so many seats to fill\, the home school's student body is not enough to fill the seats; thus\, to fill the seats\, it helps to have the game lineups scheduled well in advance so that alumni and other fans can make their plans. This cannot be accommodated by a tournament system in which lineups are uncertain. This is not a hard proof that tournaments can't bring in more revenue\, but it should give us great pause in trying to apply the techniques successful in other sports to college football.  What works in one sport doesn't necessarily work in another. In pro boxing\, a big title fight can bring in more revenue per individual fight\, and the personalities and relationships of the fighters can make some fights more interesting than others\, which are probably among the reasons why there are not regular pro boxing tournaments\, but the fights are determined with more individual discretion. The systems from the MLB or NBA (best-of-seven playoffs) probably wouldn't carry over so well to a sport like boxing\, or college football for that matter.  One finally has to consider the fact that\, if a tournament system would bring in so much more money\, this would have brought great pressure on the NCAA to implement it long ago. The fact that they haven't done so in spite of all controversy\, suggests that the current system is a very profitable one. Myth: Watching regular seasons games is interesting under tourneys\, because they affect your tournament seeding.  In reply to this\, I usually think\, "So when I see my team win\, I'm supposed to think\, 'Wow\, my team's odds of winning the tourney moved from 1% to 1.3%'?" In college football\, bowl invitations are based on the regular season\, and cannot be erased. Each regular season win has greater meaning. Myth: A winner-takes-all tournament is the only viable alternative to the bowl system.  Even if we held a tournament\, we could still base the national title on post-season rankings\, and this would be way more fair to teams that have a superior regular season. This would take into account all the information that the tournament games provide us\, but would also take the regular season results into equal consideration. E.g.\, if Oklahoma beats LSU in the regular season\, that would be every bit as relevant as Oklahoma beating LSU in the tournament under such a system. Myth: Bowls fill teams in mediocre bowls with an overblown sense of accomplishment.  Victory in a mediocre bowl is never confused by any sane sports follower with\, say\, winning the Sugar Bowl or the Fiesta Bowl. However\, I think it is one of the great advantages of the bowl system that many great teams get to cap their regular-season performances with a win. Often\, these bowl contests are among the most memorable games in a school's history\, and people who don't like that great fact\, often have little to object to this with other than mean-spiritedness.  That said\, we could argue equally well that tournament victories or strong tournament showings fill a team with a false sense of accomplishment. See the above: "Myth: The result of a winner-takes-all tournament is the best measure of the merit of a team." Myth: If I would find tournaments more exciting than bowls\, this means I would find college football as a whole more fun if there were a playoff system.  A winner-takes-all tournament steals attention away from the regular season and places it in the postseason. Even if the tournaments were more exciting\, the regular season would be much less exciting\, especially for those not in contention for a playoff spot\, or who have no serious chance of reaching a title game. So even if tournaments actually were more fun than bowls\, it doesn't make the sport more interesting as a whole. Less Flimsy Objections Objection: The bowls give too much weight to what conference a football team is in.  This one I consider to have some weight. It should be considered\, though\, that these conference-specific traditions are part of what makes the game fun for so many viewers. That said\, there are many who stand outside these conferences which have a stronger tradition. For their sake it may be better to rewrite the rules for entering many bowl games to allow members of weaker conferences a chance to take part in the more prestigious bowls. For instance\, we might have a set of rules under which the winner of the Big Ten is normally preferred to go to the Rose Bowl\, but if an at-large team had a strongly superior record\, that might trump the tradition in such a rare circumstance. But this does not constitute an argument against the bowl system\, but rather\, only an argument in favor of making bowl invitations rules more conference-neutral. Can't we fix the bowl system?  Fixing it sounds fine\, but that said\, usually the changes most people suggest are very short-sighted patches to a problem that really isn't even that big a deal in the first place. Cogent suggestions are welcome\, but in my experience\, most suggestions are mindlessly naive. For instance\, one commentator suggested that a fix to our current system\, following the previously unanimous #1 Oklahoma's loss to Kansas State in the Big 12 conference championship\, is to add a rule whereby a team must be a conference champion to win the national championship. Sounds good\, but so now USC's loss to unranked California is excused\, but Oklahoma's loss to top Kansas State (ranked #7 in computer rankings) is somehow preclusive to title contention? Give me a break. Such is the nature of most proposed "fixes" to the bowl system; they are usually resemble a clumsy game of whack-a-mole. The current system has problems but I would generally prefer to leave them as is\, and point out that the alternative systems have bigger problems rather than make a mountain out of a molehill with the problems of the current system. The other levels of NCAA football use a tournament system\, so so should Division IA.  This is kind of an apples-and-oranges comparison. No offense to smaller schools\, but far fewer people follow those divisions. The better business model for those schools is probably to concentrate the attention from their seasons into one intense playoff\, which brings in a couple games nationally televised (usually on cable) to the system. But in general\, these divisions don't struggle with the challenges of filling sixty to a hundred thousand seats per week. Also\, playoff systems are easy to administer than the more intricate bowl system. Altogether\, it is an apples-and-oranges comparison. That is not to say that a bowl system for the other divisions wouldn't be more interesting\, because maybe they would. Other Things About the Bowl System The bowl system is what keeps us madly focused on the teams' regular seasons.  The only reason that people give a damn in 2003-04 about USC's strong season is because of the bowl system. Had they entered a tournament\, win or lose\, their regular season would be pretty well a moot point by now. I thank God that it is not\, and that people talk passionately about the merits of their teams' seasons well after the season is over. In college basketball\, the regular season is usually more of an afterthought to the tournament results. Individual bowls are usually more memorable.  That's not to say that bowl games are always great to watch. But there's a certain ring in\, "Remember the 2004 Rose Bowl?" that is lacking in "Remember round 2 of the 2005 playoffs\, the game between Kansas State and OSU?" Not just for the fact that bowl games have catchier names\, but for the fact that bowl games are the exclamation marks at the end of many fine and memorable seasons; the name of the bowl itself is a strong indicator of how meritorious that season as a whole was. This concludes my thoughts for now. Finally\, to set the record straight\, I will have to admit my potential for "bias": I'm a Purdue alumnus and a big fan of Purdue football. I'm a fan of Purdue basketball\, but not nearly as much as of Purdue football. Watching college football under the bowl system has been about the most fun thing I've ever done in my life as a sports spectator.  This concludes my thoughts for the time being. Right now\, as of the time of the first draft\, I'm about to tune in to the 2004 Sugar Bowl between Oklahoma and LSU\, and no matter what the result\, the aftermath should be dramatic.

Aikido students\, May\, 2003 The late U Thaung Din Sensei Biography of Sensei Thaung Din (click here) Thank you or visiting our website. The intention of this site is to promote and support the practice of Aikido in the country of Myanmar. Aikido has been practiced in Myanmar for over 40 years. However until recently there was very little contact with the global Aikido Community. It is our hope that this website helps to create a greaterconnection and exchangebetween aikidoka in Myanmar and other countries. Please feel free to browsethe menu and visit this site. What is Aikido ? Aikido is a modern Japanese Martial Art with its roots in Japan's long history of warrior traditions. However its philosophy reflects the spiritual truths of Love\, Peace\, and Harmony. Such a combination makes Aikido a truly unique Martial Art that is both an effective self-defense\, and a methode for developing the mind and spirit. The central principle of Aikido is "Awase"\, which means to blend\, or to join. When faced with aggresion\, rather than forcing\, or resisting it\, Aikido uses the techniques of blending to join with the attackers movement\, then skillfully redirect the agression to a peaceful resolution. The techniques of Aikido are effective\, but they are neither violent nor do they cause injury to the attacker. Aikido nurtures harmony with nature and respect for mankind.   AI - Harmony\, Unity\, to be in accord with\, or to join KI - Life\, Spirit\, Force\, Universal Creative Energy DO - The Way\, Path\, or Phylosophy   => /Top/Sports/Basketball/Women/College_And_University/Ncaa_Division_I/Big_Ten_Conference/Iowa

If you are interested in a 6 month or year long placement of your advertisement then please contact us now. cuesnviews@yahoo.co.uk  Cues n Views update of the week Newsflash: We have created a small pilot video as a new dimension to the Cues n Views service. This little piece is a short experimental video so that we can learn about the process a little more. Watch for new segments covering a variety of cue collecting related topics. I do not expect fan mail but all contributions will get a reply. Only joking about the fan mail. Update: New videos completed covering valueing cues\, the Burwat Champion and the PowerGlide range featuring special guest\, Dominic Dale. Cues n Views (.com) our sister web-site. Special Notice: Please take a moment to look at the photograph on the left of this page; the cue on the left is a Sydney Smith picture badge cue while the one on the right is a hand-spliced Cannon Match cue. From 2013 I will only respond to valuation requests if they include photographs\, the length of the cue in inches\, the tip diametre in millimetres and the wqeight of the cue in ounces. (The weight of a cue can often be found as a numbered stamp on the shaft above the splice in line with the badge).Incidentally the cue on the left of the photograph is a third of the value of the cue on the right. I hope this illustrates the importance of this information. Click/tap the photo for more information. Newsflash: Craftsman Cues has begun supplying Phoenix cues. These cues are of extremely high quality. I bought one myself recently and can honestly say that I am delighted with it. Check them out on the Craftsman Cues web-site or better still visit their showroom and try one out for yourself. Craftsman Cues has exclusive UK distribution rights to the Phoenix range of cues. Newsflash: The New Cues n Views Picture Gallery - See the Gallery Develop as we input new images each week - Cues n Views (.com) Gallery Picture Gallery Picture Gallery index - cues\, books\, balls and cards. Video Gallery from the Cues n Views YouTube channel by David Smith. My Favourite Cues - Photographer Viv Welch's photos of some of the Cues n Views collection owned by David Smith. David Smith's Cue Collection - These illustrations show part of my cue collection. Photographs by Mark Warwick. Books - On this page are thunmbnail images of all the books featured on this site\, click on a linked book to see an enlargement and some information about the book. Balls - Billiard balls\, Snooker balls - a load of balls! Cards - I have gathered together a few examples of the variety of cigarette cards that are commonly available\, these cards are of course related to both Billiards and Snooker collecting. Not strictly a Gallery yet\, but there's plenty to see.  What do you want? Perhaps I should be more explicit; I collect old Billiards and Snooker cues as well as other items that take my fancy. I have most of the cues that I want so am offering a kind of matching service to you as readers of this site. I dont want to make a profit but would take great pleasure in helping you to find what you want. I also collect books and here again\, have mostly what I want\, in point of fact I believe that I have the books that I can realistically afford\, however I have a network of friends who have items that they consider surplus due to duplication that they might consider passing on should the right circumstances present themselves. If you are awaiting a reply to an enquiry for information on collecting old cues\, please be patient as the number of enquiries has dramatically increased since our launch. If you have items for sale or are looking for something please let me know Ill do what I can to help you out. All that I would ask is the cost of postage. Billiards & Snooker Exchange Pages Billiards Masterclass 2004 Video for sale New Articles Collecting: Mike Hallett Cue - In 1993 Mike Hallett the former world number five from Grimsby commissioned Glover Cues to make him a matching pair of custom made cues to suit his playing needs. Cigarette Cards In More Detail - I have gathered together a few examples of the variety of cigarette cards that are commonly available\, these cards are of course related to both Billiards and Snooker collecting. The Cues n Views archive Cues n Views is about saving old cues for future generations to enjoy and a service that aims to inform those of you that are interested in old cues about their history\, their design peculiarities and their current market value as a collectors item or for insurance purposes. Buying an old cue - If you are buying a cue to use as your own playing cue\, the decision is quite a simple one\, however if you are buying a cue in the hope that it will one day appreciate in value\, the decision is a little more complicated. (includes a tip on how to tell the difference between hand-spliced and machine-spliced cues). Interview with Dominic Dale - For those of you not familiar with Dominic Dale he is currently ranked well inside the top thirty-two Snooker players in the world. His biggest success on the pro-circuit to date was winning the 1997 Grand Prix\, defeating John Higgins in the final. A Spaceman came calling or 85 under the shade without his own cue - Imagine my surprise if you will\, a few short days ago. I picked up my messages the other day and recognised the voice included amongst these messages as the voice of Dominic Dale\, former Grand Prix Champion and in past times a rather eminent cue collector himself. Travelling for a Purchase - I recently embarked on a trip to Mansfield to look for a Read's Champion cue and came back with an early machine spliced Horace Lindrum Picture badged cue as well. Picture & signature cues\, can they make a comeback? - I am often disappointed with the badges that are used on modern cues\, little round discs are more than adequate to let the buyer know who made the cue and what model it is\, however something a little more creative would be appreciated from time to time. Big break for George Chenier - I recently received an e-mail asking for a valuation and a little additional historical information concerning a George Chenier cue. For those of you who are unaware of who George Chenier was\, well he was a Snooker player from Canada who was invited to England in 1950 by the legendary Joe Davis. Walter Donaldson the Flowing Scotsman - There is\, to my knowledge\, only one type of cue that bears the name Walter Donaldson. They were made by Peradon Limited around the time that Walter was winning the World Snooker Championships. Joe Davis Cues - There are so many Variants of the Joe Davis cue that I could create a whole web site about them. Having said that I will try to give you a flavour of what to look out for. Cues I Rarely Mention - These cues feature the names of some of the founders of modern cue sports\, Joseph Bennett\, William Cook\, John Roberts\, Charles Dawson\, Cecil Harverson\, W J Peall\, H W Stevenson and of course John Roberts Junior. Fifth Sidney Smith Cue - Until recently\, I was only aware of four Sidney Smith badged cues\, then last week I discovered a fifth. The Essential Cue Collection - Slightly for fun we have put together a list of the cues that might make up the ideal cue collection. Rare Old Books - Some of the rarer books that you might like to track down include\, such titles as the Badminton Library\, this book was first published in 1896. One Cue - Some people play snooker with one cue\, all their lives. It is not necessary to change your cue once you find one that you are comfortable with. Older Books - I have many of the older books including William Dufftons book "Practical billiards" from 1868 and John Robertss book\, Roberts on billiards from 1873. Interactive Museum - We will show the pictures of many items on this site\, in the hope of creating a kind of interactive museum. Where you can eventually look at a catalogue of items that are around and enjoy a more detailed appreciation of days gone by in the field of both Snooker and English Billiards. What's Yours? - Where you one of the people that sent a Burwat Champion to Alex Higgins\, in the hope of helping him to win a third world championship? Do you own a matching pair of custom built "Eurekas"\, do you use a John Roberts cue to help your Tomatoes to grow straight? Let me Know. Norman Clare - Norman Clare gathered together a wonderful collection of Snooker and Billiards memorabilia that is kept at the Liverpool offices of Thurston. Includes link to the Cues n Views Norman Clare Retrospective . Modern Books - It is interesting to note that 2001 is the 20 th anniversary of Steve Davis winning his first World Snooker title. This means that his two book autobiography is virtually 20 years old\, these books are worth reading as they capture moments in time that are long gone now. Future Collectibles - To start a worthwhile cue collection is not as difficult as you might think. Some of the more modern cues are quite attractive and will no doubt appreciate in value over the coming years. Cigarette Cards - I am just starting to learn a little something about the very interesting subject of Cigarette Card collecting\, this subject is new to me. Includes link to Cigarette Cards In More Detail . Temptation to Sell - The down side of owning a rare billiard or snooker cue is that the temptation to sell it can come upon you quite suddenly and after selling the feeling of loss can be quite long lasting. W J Peall - I sometimes wonder what kind of Snooker player Peall would have been if either the game had taken his interest or\, if he had been born twenty years later. The Lindrum Selection of Cues - Walter and Horace Lindrum were Uncle and Nephew cueists from Australia. Between them they won many snooker and billiards tournaments. Collect or Tinker? - I recently received an e-mail asking what should he collect and where should he start. Tinkering with cues yourself\, is not in my opinion a good idea as it often results in the cue becoming unplayable. Balls - We collectors are a weird breed\, you know\, I have even gathered together a small collection of balls. Autographs - Some people only collect non mass-produced items\, such as personally autographed items; perhaps they feel closer to the subject of their collection by owning things that their subject has touched? Books - Collecting early books has become quite expensive in recent years; I first started collecting mine in second hand shops paying on average 5. Unfortunately\, this situation didnt last long but I suppose that Ive had my fair share of bargains. Peradon Limited - If you see an old cue with a players name\, face or record break on the badge with no other makers name included\, chances are that Peradon made the cue. Now includes My Peradon Cues . Opinion: 2004 Grand Prix - I spent a great day at the Grand Prix Snooker on Saturday 2nd October 2004 as a guest of my friend Dominic Dale. U.K. Professional Snooker championships 2003 - Visiting the UK Championships in York this week has been a very great pleasure\, not only did my friend Dominic Dale win his first match but I also saw a number of good players in action. Arenas - On a visit to the qualifying competition for the Powerhouse United Kingdom Professional Snooker championships 2002 in York I was struck by the situation that the top and former top players find themselves competing in. Where are they now? - As both Snooker and Billiards are now recognised as young mens games\, I find myself wondering what happened to certain players who graced our television screens only a few short years ago. Mike Russell; is he the last of a dying breed? - Mike Russell\, along with a small group of devotees has kept the game of competitive Billiards going over the past few years. Along with holding down a day job\, he has also managed to maintain his skills and travel the world in search of competition. The Ladies Game - In searching out the roots of both Billiards and Snooker it would be remiss of me not to include a little something about the womens or as it used to be known in gentler times\, "The ladies game. Competitions News n Views Index Page - Articles by David Smith on current and past competitions. The 2002 Benson & Hedges Masters is the latest Snooker competition to be covered. An impressive Billiads tournament is the first competition of 2003 to be covered. Cue Stories - Cue stories abound from the early days of billiards until today. Spectacles - I was born with cataracts and later developed Glaucoma\, an eye disorder that means that fluid normally found in the eye does not drain away and so builds up destructive pressure unless medication is administered. The Nineteen Eighties - As shocking as it may seem the 1980s are fast becoming historical times for the game of Snooker\, the players of this era are considered by the youngsters in the clubs to be from a totally different time. Scoring Power - What concentration must it have taken for players like Newman\, Davis and Lindrum to allow them to make Billiard breaks numbering in the thousands? World's best player? - Many people have recently begun to say that Ronnie OSullivan is the best player ever to pick up a cue. Outsider? - Perhaps it is a good thing that I don't know all the internal wrangling that plague my favourite sport. Convention? - If this event was promoted effectively and run for the fans rather than purely for business people I think that it would bring the game back to the people. Epic Matches - When you watch a Snooker match\, what are the things that stick in your mind long term? Snooker Etiquette - I don't think that we need worry too much about the state of the game at grass roots level\, but I would like to do my bit to keep things this way.

Next Match League Table Widget powered by WhatstheScore.com Leeds United News 24/7   A total lack of respect 19 May 2015 05:50pm\, by Shields53 Ive not put pen to paper yet on Cellinos rant about Redfearn in the Mirror\, mainly because I was too busy arguing with people on Twitter. But with the rumours that Cellino wants to make a decision on the new manager tonight it looks as though Redfearn only has hours left as head coach. Im not going to suggest for one minute that Neil Redfearn is the best coach in the world\, hes not. With a win rate at just 33% for his last spell in charge he ranks alongside Hockaday and his success rate in terms of points from points available puts him behind Brian McDermott and Neil Warnock. But that isnt the point is it? The point is that Cellino has shown a total lack of respect to Redfearn. Im sure everyone has read the comments but just to reiterate them; He thinks that hes so strong that he can put me in the s**t because Im worrying about the fans. He tried to play the fans against me to keep his place. Do you think that Neil Redfearn loves Leeds more than me? Tell me why I am in Leeds\, why am I so involved with the club? Why am I putting in a lot of money\, killing myself? Because I fell in love with this club. But to love this club is to do something for this club. Neil Redfearn does salute. He challenged me. If you are good I can accept the challenge. But not if you are a bad coach. He wins two games and he disappears. He loses five games and he comes to me to ask my advice. Then he wins and disappears again. He has to respect the chairman. He has to respect the club. Hes like a baby. Hes been badly advised and used by someone. He is not a bad person but he has a weak personality. Since Cellino returned from his ban he has not picked up the phone to speak with his head coach. Instead he makes these comments to a national newspaper. Any coach Cellino hires isn't going to get great odds on lasting long in football betting atbonus.org.uk . Whatever his reasons for wanting Redfearn gone it would have been the respectful thing to speak to him\, either by phone or in person and clarify the situation. To go behind someones back and make comments such as those to a national newspaper is without justification or class. But thats Cellinos style. He came with a reputation for sacking managers but in reality he seems to always get someone to do his dirty work for him. Chris Farnell\, Nicola Salerno\, Andrew Umbers; its always someone else who has to deliver the news\, never Cellino himself. Whatever your views on Redfearn he does deserve respect. In six years at the club as youth coach\, academy manager and head coach he has put his all into Leeds United. He has overseen the development of a talented bunch of young players and nurtured them into first team regulars. His results at the start of this year secured our safety following the sticky patch under Darko Milanic . Likewise McDermott\, Hockaday and Milanic were shown little respect. As Cellino said; With managers I fall in love. And when I fall in love I give love. And then they try to take advantage. Its much better if you dont fall in love with your coach\, and then he screws them over. Three candidates are rumoured to be in the frame for the job including Uwe Rosler \, but why would anyone want the job now? Why would anyone want to work for Cellino. They may navely think they will be the one to buck the trend but I dont think Cellino will ever change. If you dont get the results you are sacked for not performing\, if you get the results you are sacked for taking the focus away from Cellino and trying to take advantage. Its a no win situation. Redfearn had time whilst Cellino was away from the club to bring in the youth players and develop the team the way he wanted\, the minute Cellino is back\, hes out the door. I fear we will never be stable\, never have time to develop whilst our Chairman shows his coaches and staff such a total lack of respect. So\, with it looking like Redfearns future will be sealed tonight I wish him many thanks for all he has done and all the best for his future career. Whoever is next in the dugout\, I wish you luck\, you are going to need every bit you can get with this mad man in charge. 10 Comments Busy summer ahead for Leeds 18 May 2015 09:13pm\, by Shields53 The 2014/15 Championship season might have only just finished but on-the-pitch matters have never felt so far away after a week that will go down in the already ridiculous recent history of the club. While it's now embarrassingly clear that Neil Redfearn won't be the one leading us into next season\, the question as to just what state the squad will be in by the time the new campaign gets under way is almost as pressing as to who exactly will be putting the cones out. Massimo Cellino has again admitted he made errors in terms of recruitment last summer\, assembling a squad of relative unknowns from the Italian leagues\, but it remains to be seen whether the decisive Leeds owners promise to focus on British-based players when it comes to transfers comes to fruition. Andrea the furniture salesman is all set up with his office and DVD player\, and now we'll see whether he's as good at picking out talented players as he was at somehow convincing Mrs Cellino to hand him a job in an English football club. Even at this early stage of the summer\, it feels as though we've endured more drama than other clubs have to go through in a decade. But if we know one thing about Cellino\, we can expect at least another couple of jaw-dropping moments before the new season starts. But rather than trying to decipherer what's going on in the asylum that is the current Leeds United boardroom\, how is the squad looking as we head into the summer and what do we need if we have any chance of making it back into the Premier League next year - one of the many things Cellino initially claimed would happen when he first bought the club? Goalkeepers\, what we have Following the decision to allow everyone's favourite reserve goalkeeper\, Stuart Taylor\, to leave at the end of his contract this summer\, as well as the departure of third choice Alex Cairns\, it looks as though Leeds could be looking for at least one new shot-stopper before the start of the new season. But it may be that Cellino is left looking for a new number one if Marco Silvestri decides he'd rather not return to Leeds after his part in the "injured six" and absence from the end-of-season lap of honour. The Italian was one of the few success stories from last summer's recruitment\, producing a string of incredible performances to establish himself as a firm fan favourite before his role\, unfortunate or not\, in the apparent player protest - albeit a role he may have played without knowing. As it stands\, Eric Grimes looks set to sign a new contract with the club and the youngster\, who has appeared in the Republic of Ireland's Under-21s\, could have a role to play in the first team set-up next season. Goalkeepers\, what we need There were few noticeable absentees from Leeds' final game of the season against Rotherham\, none more so than owner Cellino\, who was reportedly at Morecambe to take a look at Southend goalkeeper Daniel Bentley rather than joining the 31\,000 at the Elland Road. Cellino's interest in the young English keeper casts a shadow over Silvestri's future\, unless the Leeds owner wants another goalkeeper to challenge the Italian for his place. While it remains to be seen whether or not Silvestri will still be at the club next season\, signing a talented young English player would be an encouraging start to the summer. Grimes has looked good in the development side this year and the Irishman may now take Cairns role as third choice this season. Defenders\, what we need Following the end of Sol Bamba's loan spell\, the big Ivorian has returned to his parent club Palermo\, and it remains to be seen whether the centre-back will return. In his absence\, Liam Cooper\, Giuseppe Bellusci and Scott Wootton remain as the only recognisable centre-backs\, a loose term based on some of their performances last season. While Cooper initially impressed following his switch from Chesterfield and was awarded the captaincy following Jason Pearce's move to Wigan\, the 23-year-old is still learning his craft and was guilty of some below-par performances during the second half of the season. Bellusci is one of those players who divides opinion\, it's just that it's more of an 80/20 split on the defender\, with the majority not sure the Italian has what it takes to handle English football. Combine that with Bellusci's apparent refusal to play during the final weeks of season and there wouldn't be that many Leeds fans overly upset to see the back of the former Catania defender in the summer. Wootton is an interesting one. He is a jack of all trades but a master of none. But despite his slow start to life at Elland Road\, the former Manchester United youngster has shown that he is probably worth keeping around for his versatility as much as anything. Gaetano Berardi might have started his Leeds career by kung-fu kicking opponents and working on his appearance to red card ratio\, but the Swiss full-back put in more than a few shifts during the final half of the season\, not to mention making a point of playing despite struggling with an ankle problem in order to distance himself from the 'injured six'. In Sam Byram and Charlie Taylor\, we have two of the best young Championship full-backs\, both of whom all Leeds fans will be hoping are offered new contracts this summer. Defenders\, what we need The first thing Cellino should be doing this summer is ensuring Bamba is signed up on a permanent deal from Palermo after his successful loan spell this year . The Ivorian added experience and leadership to a defence that desperately needed it in the second half of the season\, and the big centre-back proved to Leeds fans that he not only understands what it takes to play for the club\, he embraces it. If Cellino wants to add a more consistent centre-back to the squad in favour of the often erratic Bellusci\, he needs to go the Bamba-route again and bring in a player who is proven in English football. The club could also do with another left-back to provide cover for Charlie Taylor next year\, although Berardi has shown he is more than capable of filling in that side of defence and there are other areas of the team that need focusing on if Leeds are going to convince anyone to visit betfair and back them for promotion . Midfielders\, what we have Well\, it's goodbye Rudy Austin\, Aidy White\, Michael Tonge\, Zac Thompson\, Zan Benedicic and Granddi N'Goyi but our midfield is an area where Leeds have looked strongest this year. The incredible debut season exploits of Lewis Cook have been well documented and the academy graduate has been a key part of a central midfield that has looked as good as any in the Championship at times this season. While it's been Cook who has taken much of the focus\, Alex Mowett deserves plenty of credit and it's no surprise to see the youngster being linked with a host of big name clubs\, although there is hope the midfielder will agree a new deal this summer like Cook. Kalvin Phillips looks as though he is the next one off the Thorpe Arch production line\, and his goalscoring debut against Cardiff was a rare highlight this season. After a shocking start to the season\, it looked as though Luke Murphy's Leeds career was never going to get going. The arrival of Steve Thompson appears to have been the catalyst for Murphy's turnaround in fortunes \, though\, and the former Crewe man has been one of the best players at the club since Christmas. While those three players have been successes this season\, the same can't be said for a number of those brought into the club last summer. Aside from a solid showing in a pre-season game against Dundee United \, it's hard to see what Tommaso Bianchi did to warrant his ever-present inclusion during the first half of the campaign. After Christmas\, when Redfearn moved away from the diamond formation\, the Italian found himself out of the team before a brief return was cut short thanks to a knee injury\, and you'd be hard-pressed to find many Leeds fans\, aside from those loyal few\, who would be overly bothered about seeing Bianchi leave. Casper Sloth is another one who could be on his way this summer\, although the Dane could feel that the departure of Redfearn could open the door for a return to the first team. And then there's little Chris Dawson \, who is still yet to establish himself in the senior side despite all his potential. While it's clear the playmaker needs regular football at this stage of his career\, it's not clear whether he'll be able to achieve that at Elland Road. Midfielders\, what we need As is tradition with Leeds\, we start the summer desperately needing wingers. Granted\, the last time we signed wingers they were called Jimmy Kebe and Cameron Stewart\, that's not to say we should go all David Hockaday and just do away with the thought of width. As it stands\, there are no recognised wingers at the club and Redfearn was the latest in a string of Leeds head coach/managers who made it clear he could really do with someone\, anyone\, capable of playing out wide. As long as Cook\, Mowett and Murphy are still Leeds players at the start of next season\, we're going to have a midfield many in the Championship are going to envy. Strikers\, what we have Not the strongest area of the Leeds team this year. Scoring became something of a problem this season\, with the strikers only weighing in with a combined 22 goals all year. Billy Sharp failed to ever really get going following his move from Southampton\, scoring just five goals in his first season at the club and never really settling. A proven goalscorer at this level \, it would be a shame to sell Sharp only for him to pop up at another Championship club and score 25 goals next season\, which would almost certainly happen. The same can't be said for Steve Morison\, who is contracted for another year at Elland Road. Sure\, the former Millwall man put in his fair of shifts after his return to the first team\, but if we harbour any ambition of going up this year\, we're going to need better strikers than Morison. Mirco Antenucci and Souleymane Doukara both started the season in encouraging fashion\, but for the final few months of the year it's fair to say neither tore up too many trees\, and both were involved in the now infamous 'sicknote six' pull-out before the Charlton game. To be fair to Antenucci\, the Italian always worked hard when on the pitch and proved on a number of occasions that he can finish\, ending his first year at the club as the top scorer with 10 goals. In Doukara's case\, the forward looked uninterested and lazy whenever he appeared from the bench after losing his place in the team after Christmas\, and the Frenchman is another player Leeds fans wouldn't be that bothered about losing. Young Lewis Walters missed the majority of the season with a knee injury but the quick forward has shown enough in the development side to warrant being given a chance next season. Strikers\, what we need Two questions Cellino needs to ask himself before buying a new striker this summer is\, do they have the ability to score regular goals in the Championship \, and are they definitely\, positively NOT Edgar Cani. While one of those is much easier to guarantee than the other\, Leeds need to make sure they get it right in this department if they are going to have any chance of promotion. The likes of Sharp\, Antenucci and\, at one time\, Morison have both proven they have what it takes to score goals in this league\, but if Cellino doesn't think any of the strikers at the club is capable of scoring 20-plus goals next year\, he needs to go and sign someone he knows can. 0 Comments More stories from Marching on Together...

Ashmar Farm HORSES IN MEMORY OF BLONDIE  August 12\, 1998 my aged grade mare "Blondie" passed away. She was patient and kind. Blondie touched many lives in her time with us. She gave pony rides to raise money for our pony club\, and to special needs children at the school where I work. She had a very special friend\, Jill\, who thought she was as wonderful as I did. I will always remember our special times together\, her funny unique "donkey scream"\, and her greetings as I came and went. Blondie\, you were the best.  Dandi is our aged 1/2 arabian appaloosa mare. Ashley bought her to use as a pony club mount. They make a great team!  Small Wonder Pony Club runs a "tack shop" to help pay for pony club expenses.

The sport of college basketball and its coaches have a serious man crush on the NBA. It is no coincidence that\, of 12 major points of emphasis handed down from the rules committee on Friday\, nine of them-a full 75%-are moves toward NBA standards\, if not downright duplications. At this point the rules are proposals\, but its considered a formality that they will pass in June.

It was down this year\, and at times during the season it was the subject of much debate because of some painfully low-scoring games we saw in 2014-15. Scoring has been down for a while now\, and there are lots of theories about it as well as solution ideas. One solution idea has been bandied about quite a bit\, to the point where it seems inevitable it will come. If it does\, we cant get our hopes up. Simply put\, we shouldnt expect rule changes to solve all our problems.  Continue Reading No Comments | Tags: NCAA \, rule changes \, scoring A 45-second shot clock for college basketball? Why not? by Adam Glatczak - Published April 29\, 2015 in Columns If it wasnt already the case\, it seems that based on the ESPN report earlier this week\, the 30-second shot clock for mens college basketball is inevitable. Its not surprising news\, but it is unfortunate. Not necessarily because a30-second clock is an immediately terrible move-though its not a good one\, and may even turn out to bea really bad one-but because its going to be done for the wrong reasons. The idea that a 30-second shot clock will help the sport at all is highly debatable. Given suchuncertainty of success\, one would think there is a thicker threshold or burden of proof before a rule change was implemented than a few loud voices crying ofthe sport being in a crisis\, while a few others push almost certainly because it is in their teams best interests.

The second and final adidas Gauntlet session came to a close on Sunday with a flurry of games in a short time. All of the teams will play in the Super 64 in Las Vegas in July\, but this and the session two weeks ago in Dallas were qualifiers for the adidas Gauntlet Finale in Atlanta on July 8-10\, which will feature 16 teams. Most of the games I viewed on Sunday were not very competitive\, though the last one had a somewhat surprising end. After Team Philly had a hot start to the second half and seemed poised to take over the game\, they never built their lead\, and the Utah Prospects slowly came back and then won going away.

Fans might say otherwise by Adam Glatczak - Published April 27\, 2015 in Columns It is virtually accepted as fact by now that the sport of college basketball is in an important offseason. With so much discussion of the sports state\, that has become a truth\, but the reality is the spring and summer of 2015 maybe more crucial for what shouldnt be done than what should be. In its attempt to satisfy howls calling for change\, college basketball could just as easily create new problems as it could fix the sport. Changes could peel away at the uniqueness of the college game\, and in the eyes of fans firmly entrench the sport as nothing more than a far less-talented version of the NBA.

The second session of the adidas Uprising circuit is near Indianapolis this weekend.

Starting on Saturday morning\, most of the matchups are determined by prior results\, as bracket play begins. Its a little different from how it was done last year. Saturday will be a full day of action\, with a few of the matchups now known and many more dependent on the outcome of Saturdays games over the course of the day.

This spring is a bit unusual as the travel team schedule goes\, as the two live weekends for college coaches have another weekend sandwiched in between. In the northeast\, the place to be was the Northeast Hoops Festival\, held primarily at the University Sports Complex. Saturday was full of pool play games\, while Sunday was the time for playoffs and a couple of round robin sets of games with some premiere teams in the area. The round robin series featuring Expressions\, Mass Rivals\, Metro Boston and the New England Playaz grabbed a lot of attention and saw good crowds. The game action lived up to its billing as well.

Pekiti Tirsia International Home About PTI What Is The PTI System History PTI Outline PTI Membership Testimonials Seminars Store Schools National Directors State Directors Other Contacts Photos News Links Contact Us Welcome to the Official Website of Pekiti-Tirsia International Tuhon Guro William R. McGrath President & Chief Instructor Welcome to the Official Pekiti-Tirsia International Website. Bill McGrath started his training in Pekiti-Tirsia in 1975 at the age of 14. In 1994 Bill McGrath was promoted to the rank of Tuhon Guro (Chief Instructor) by Grandmaster Leo Gaje. A year later Tuhon McGrath started an official organization with the aim of preserving and promoting a single art\, Pekiti-Tirsia. That organization is called Pekiti-Tirsia International. The aim of this new organization was that it be free from the politics and internal strife that Tuhon McGrath had seen plague so many martial arts and organizations down through the years. It seems that as an art grows in popularity it also grows in political intrigue and disputes over rank. To accomplish this goal of a politics free environment\, Tuhon McGrath structured Pekiti-Tirsia International in such a way that anyone can become legitimately trained and ranked in the system. In Pekiti-Tirsia International: There are no secret techniques All the techniques to complete the entire system are clearly outlined in an easy to follow series of two test books called Blue Books. Each page of the Blue Books consists of two sections that need to be approved by a certified PTI instructor. The first section is stamped when you are instructed in the technique. This means a certified instructor has taught you and explained to you the technique. After you understand and become proficient with the technique\, you can test on that technique with a certified PTI instructor. Pass the test and your book is stamped as passed for that section of technique: clean\, clear and simple proof that you have passed that section of instruction.Once the books are filled up you finish the system and can pass it on. There is a known ranking structure The system consists of a structured ranking system. Outside of this list there are no other levels. The techniques are consistent from instructor to instructor All the techniques in the system are clearly outlined and available on video tape from your instructor. Any instructor who finishes their Blue Book can train you on any page in your book and you can rest assured that the techniques are the same from instructor to instructor.

But I also follow JF Boutin as he plays with the Peoria Rivermen . What kind of adopted brother would I be if I didn't support him? Naturally I still think you should all go and visit The JF Boutin Pages . If nothing else just for all of the work that went into it. Please send me your opinions and comments. Been listening to a lot of Peoria's radio/RealAudio announcer Norm Ulrich. I would rate Norm as one of the ECHL's top 5 announcers. I get to listen to him a lot trying to keep up with JF 's career\, and since Wheeling did not get RealAudio this year. Also\, I would like to send a special thanks to Shaun and Kim Bill from Peoria for helping keep us filled in on what's been going on there. You can still get your game updates at one of these sites:  I would also like for everyone to drop by the site for our adopted player for last season Rob Giffin with the Arkansas GlacierCats of the WPHL . Oddly enough\, Wheeling Nailers got him in the trade with the Peoria Rivermen for JF Boutin and he also wears #7 on his jersey. After the move to Arkansas GlacierCats he has chnaged to the number 8. I am looking for somebody from his new team that will adopt the web page for him and keep it up to date\, but you may visit what has been completed before his move. This year our adopted player again did not arrive speaking English. This year we have Vladimir Gratchev from Moscow\, Russia. And just before Christmas his wife and daughter got to join him in Wheeling. It was a great pleasuer getting to know them all.

The DiaTribe skip to main | skip to sidebar Sunday\, May 24\, 2015 A Memorial Lazy Sunday Nearly two months into the 2015 major league baseball season\, the Indians pretty much are who we thought they were. That we even encompasses those (myself included) who thought they were a playoff team in 2015. Theyre a decent team with exceptional starting pitching\, a solid (if unspectacular) lineup\, a below-average bullpen and a dumpster fire defensively. Again\, this is more or less what we saw coming into this season. If anything\, the starting pitching has actually been better than expected\, and a bounceback season from Jason Kipnis has helped propel the offense to the upper half of the AL. But the defense has been worse than anyone couldve possibly imagined\, dragging the club down in the AL Central standings like an anchor. To help illustrate that point\, Im going to have to throw some advanced stats at you\, so bear with me here. The Indians team ERA sits at a rather pedestrian 4.31 (all stats as of Friday). That is good for 24 th in all of baseball. Pretty poor\, really\, and if youd asked someone in 1994 if the Indians pitching staff was good\, theyd say absolutely not. But you and I\, were smarter than that. We watch the games. We see the Klubot\, Cookie\, Bauer and Salazar striking out hitter after hitter\, only to see soft groundballs somehow leak through the infield with nary a glove nearby. We watch Mike Aviles (sorry to bring this one up) try to track down a ball in center\, coming up empty and wondering what he was even doing in CF to begin with. We know that the Indians starting pitching has been outstanding\, but with the team ERA being what it is\, we dont really have a way to quantify that in a single\, all-encompassing stat. Fear not\, fellow frustrated fan. We DO have a stat that looks at every aspect of what a pitcher can and cannot control and assigns a value to what he and he alone does on the diamond. No\, Im not talking about WAR. WAR is nice\, but its not really predictive and isnt as useful in such small samples. Im talking about cFIP\, or contextual fielding independent pitching. An improvement over the traditional FIP\, cFIP accounts for everything going on in a game; the pitcher\, hitter\, defense\, umpire\, catcher framing\, ballpark\, hot dog race participantseverything. Heres a complete primer on cFIP from Jonathan Judge of Hardball Times if youre interested in learning more \, but Ive snipped a couple of key excerpts here that help us understand why its such a useful stat: cFIP has multiple advantages: (1) it is more predictive than other pitcher estimators\, especially in smaller samples; (2) it is calculated on a batter-faced basis\, rather than innings pitched; (3) it is park-\, league-\, and opposition-adjusted; and (4) in a particularly important development\, cFIP is equally accurate as a descriptive and predictive statistic. The last characteristic makes cFIP something we have not seen before: a true pitcher quality estimator that actually approximates the pitchers current ability. I recommend both its use and its further refinement. ~snip~ When is a pitcher quality estimator actually isolating true talent? My answer is this: when there is a substantial similarity between the estimators descriptive and predictive power. If an estimator is truly isolating a pitchers talent\, there should not be much difference between the two. If an estimator is doing well in one aspect and poorly on another\, then it is not estimating a pitchers true ability: rather\, it is over-fitting past results to better explain what happened (primarily descriptive) or under-fitting past results to minimize future error (primarily predictive). So now that weve established that cFIP is an excellent tool for both analyzing past performance and predicting future success\, where do the Indians rank in terms of cFIP? Why\, first in all of baseball\, with a cFIP score of 82 (like OPS+\, cFIP is scored so that 100 is exactly average. Lower cFIP is better than higher). That number is especially remarkable when you consider that the next-closest club is the Clayton Kershaw-led Dodgers at 92. That 10-point difference between the Indians and Dodgers is the same as the difference between the #2 Dodgers and #22 Atlanta Braves. The Indians have the best pitching in baseball\, and its really not even close. So why are the Indians scuffling along with fewer than 20 wins in the seasons first 40 games? Look no further than the defense\, which yet again is THE WORST in all of baseball. Theyre dead last in both Defensive Efficiency and Park Adjusted Defensive Efficiency. Theyre last in BABIP against\, with opposing offenses hitting a robust (and probably unsustainable) .331 against them when they make contact. The 2 nd -worst are the Washington Nationals\, all the way down at .322. The Indians are 28 th (hey\, progress!) in Defensive Runs Saved. This confirms all of our offseason fears about the defense. They can indeed be bad enough at fielding the ball to counteract just how great they are at pitching the ball. There are\, however\, encouraging signs to be found within this sea of statistics. The Detroit Tigers\, for instance\, lead baseball with a .334 BABIP. Kansas City is 2 nd at .322. Both of those numbers are likely to regress at some point. Kansas City has been just as lucky in the field as they have been at the plate; KCs BABIP-against is a paltry .260\, a full 71 points lower than the Indians\, and a number that cant help but rise as the season progresses. The Indians are likely to improve on their record\, and the Royals (and to an extent the Tigers) will surely cool off after their sizzling start. Will the three clubs respective move towards the mean be enough to see the Indians pass one or both of their AL Central rivals for a playoff spot? Time will tell\, but if not\, we know where to place the blame; squarely on the defense. But do we really have to wait until September to look back and curse the horrendous defense that ruined such outstanding pitching? Is there really no solution available in mid-season that could fix what ails this club? Well\, it just so happens that there are reinforcements on the horizon. In the near-term\, the Indians are getting Yan Gomes back today. Gomes is an above-average defensive catcher\, and will slide average defensive catcher Roberto Perez back to a reserve role where he belongs. Perez has been serviceable as a fill-in for Gomes\, but is far better suited to be a backup than an everyday catcher at the major league level. Gomes return to the lineup is akin to the tide coming in; the Gomes tide will lift the boats containing the defense\, pitching and the lineup all in one fell swoop. Thats both the easiest and most imminent move to improve the D (and the team). Move two is something I wont belabor\, because its a train Ive been aboard for a while now. That\, of course\, is to promote Francisco Lindor to the major league roster and play him as the everyday shortstop. Lindor is a superlative defender who would be an immediate upgrade over Jose Ramirez\, who is flat-out overmatched as an everyday shortstop. Ramirez has value\, but that value is as a super-utility guy who can play 2B\, SS or 3B several times a week\, spotting Chiz/Kip against tough lefties and filling in at SS when the need arises. But hes a poor defender at SS\, and the 22-year old switch-hitter is hitting just .195/.265/.264 this season. Even if Lindors bat isnt a finished product (which it isnt)\, its hard to offer less value than a .526 OPS. Lindor makes this team better today by virtue of his defense alone\, and thats worth having him on the major league roster sooner rather than later. My third idea is to move David Murphy to a club hungry for outfield help in exchange for a bullpen arm. Despite the mentality of Indians beat writer Paul Hoynes\, Murphy is expendable\, and with him off the roster the Indians would be able to bring up the more versatile James Ramsey. Ramsey will likely be a better defender than Murphy\, and can play all 3 OF spots. Hes a better hitter than Tyler Holt\, and will help prevent Mike Aviles from ever appearing in CF again. If Murphy can fetch a contributing bullpen arm\, Id do this deal in a heartbeat. Murphy is playing well right now\, but hes more or less redundant with all of the other left handed hitting OF on the roster. Hes doing a nice job this season\, hitting .312/.341/.481 primarily against right handed pitching\, but that .822 OPS would be the 2 nd -highest of his career over a full season\, and is unlikely to continue at that rate. Murphy is a good guy and a solid player\, but hes a subpar defender and Id rather have another bullpen arm right now. Moving on from the current teams struggles for a moment\, Joseph Werner from Beyond the Box Score has a nice write-up confirming what most of us had already concluded; the Indians won both the C.C. Sabathia and Cliff Lee trades. Or\, at the very least\, theyd pull the trigger on each of those trades again even with the benefit of hindsight. Judging a trade in the immediate aftermath is silly\, especially when the deal involves acquiring prospects in return for an established major leaguer. The Indians front office was roundly roasted for not getting enough in return for their Cy Young Award-winning pitchers after Matt LaPorta flamed out and Jason Knapp reinjured his shoulder. But here we are in 2015\, with an OF coming off of a 6-win season and a solid #2 starter\, both under team control for the long term\, and those trades are looking awfully good: And for the first five seasons after dealing their pitching stalwarts\, it looked as if all the front office had to show for their collective efforts was a league average regular left fielder\, who hit like a center fielder and lacked the pop for a corner spot\, and a frustratingly fringy back-of-the-rotation arm. They were\, in every sense of the word\, the last men standing from their respective deals as the other prospects petered out. Something funny happened over the past season-plus  not funny in the traditional sense\, mind you\, but more in the way of nobody-saw-it-coming  both players took developmental leaps forward. The corner outfielder hit like a legitimate middle-of-the-order impact bat and the maddening\, inconsistent right-hander suddenly became\, well\, consistently dominant. The Sabathia and Lee trades\, the Ubaldo deal\, Casey Blake for Carlos Santana\, YAN GOMES and Mike Aviles for Esmil Rodgersthe Indians front office has done a remarkable job acquiring talent via trade over the past decade. Speaking of Carlos Carrasco\, Mike Podhorzer of Fangraphs has a nice breakdown of Cookies 2014 vs his 2015. Carrasco lowered his ERA to 4.74 with a win against the Reds Friday night\, so there may be those out there who see him as a disappointment after his electric 2 nd half last year. Podhorzer goes deeper into Carrascos 2015 to show that hes actually pitching much like he did last year\, but hes been let down by luck and the defense (surprise!) thus far. Carrascos K rate and walk rate are nearly identical\, and hes actually throwing more strikes this year than he did last year. His FIP is 2.62 (he finished with a 2.44 FIP last year)\, but his ERA is more than 2 runs higher (4.74 this year to 2.55 last year). The biggest difference is in BABIP. Cookie limited hitters to a .274 average on balls in play last year\, but thats jumped to a whopping .359 this season. Theres no way that lasts\, even with the Indians horrific defense. Carrasco remains an excellent pitcher\, so please dont be that guy at the water cooler citing his high ERA as a reason why last year was a fluke. It wasnt\, and Carrascos numbers reflect that. Id be remiss if I didnt bring up the incredible season that Jason Kipnis is having\, as hes in the midst of one of the best stretches that Ive seen from an Indians hitter in years. As the Indians leadoff hitter\, Kipnis is hitting a sizzling .387/.480/.632 with 4 HR and 15 RBI in 26 games. In 20 games during the month of May\, Kip is hitting .463/.546/.732\, good for a 1.278(!) OPS. In terms of wRC this month\, his 259 trails only Bryce Harpers 296 mark in all of baseball. Hes leading the American League with 57 hits\, and his 2.5 WAR are more than he accumulated in all of last season. His defense has been better this year as well\, as hes been worth 0.4 dWAR (1.1 better than his -0.7 dWAR in 2014). Hes fueling an offense that ranks 5 th in the AL with a combined .730 OPS\, and the Indians have been a different team since he moved into the leadoff spot. The challenge for Kipnis will be to sustain this success throughout the season. Hes a career .325/.396/.554 hitter in the month of May\, but has averaged a sub-.700 OPS in July-September. If Kip can maintain anything approaching this pace for the rest of the season\, itll go a long ways towards supporting the Indians outstanding starting pitching down the stretch. Its Memorial Day weekend here in the US\, an occasion that some see as significant because of the day off work and the start of summer BBQ season. Fortunately\, we have a couple of excellent articles that both tie into baseball and remind us of the significance of the holiday. Zack Meisel of the Plain Dealer wrote a fantastic piece about a local baseball star who gave up his major league dreams for pilots wings\, becoming a Special Forces helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. He tragically perished while flying a team of US Navy SEALS into enemy territory attempting to rescue Marcus Lutrell and the other SEALS in Operation Red Wings. This op would eventually be detailed the book and movie Lone Survivor. As Meisel himself tweeted\, if you only read one thing hes written\, make it that article. In addition to Meisels fabulous effort\, Graham Watson of Yahoo Sports penned an article about Chris Moon\, Atlanta Braves draftee and University of Arizona baseball star who dropped out of Arizona to join the Army in 2007. Moon volunteered for the airborne\, then for sniper school and wound up in Afghanistan as a sniper for the 82 nd Airborne. Moon was killed by a coward with an IED near Kandahar. He was just 20 years old. Brave men and women have been fighting and dying for America since before we were even a country. Memorial Day was established in the wake of the Civil War as a time to honor those soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. So by all means\, enjoy a couple of cold beers and a burger (or three) at a barbecue this weekend. But while you do\, take a moment to appreciate the men and women who have fought and died over the past 250 or so years so that we can live in freedom to enjoy baseball\, BBQ and apple pie. Posted by Al Ciammaichella 0 comments  Sunday\, April 26\, 2015 Playing Defense on a Lazy Sunday Nearly three weeks into the season\, the Indians have scuffled their way to a 6-10 record and find themselves at the bottom of the very competitive AL Central division. Just when it looked like the Tribe had found some momentum after a 13-1 shellacking of the Tigers\, Trevor Bauer came down with food poisoning before yesterdays start and the Indians were unable to get anything going in yet another loss to their AL Central foes. TJ House made an emergency start and held the Tigers to three runs in three innings of work\, a decent outing considering the circumstances. But the offensive outburst from Friday night didnt carry over to Saturday\, and Brandon Moss (whos OPS spiked nearly 200 points after his 2 HR\, 2B\, 7 RBI game on Friday) failed twice go score a runner from 3B with less than 2 outs in a 4-1 loss. Its still early\, but the 2015 Indians seem to have the same problems that plagued the 2014 Indians; poor defense\, lack of timely hitting and a complete and utter inability to beat Detroit on a regular basis. Grantlands Jonah Keri checked in with his weekly power rankings on Monday\, slotting the then 4-7 Indians in at #15 overall. Since Keris weekly focus was on defense\, its no surprise that he chose to expound on the Indians ranking. Keri notes that\, following a season in which the Indians were the worst defensive team in baseball\, theyve opened the 2015 season as the second worst defensive team in baseball. Sotheyre trending upwards? Keri goes on to note that while the Indians have and will continue to suffer with defensive limitations\, it might not matter as much due to the propensity of the Indians rotation to strike out everyone in the world. It only takes a quick look at the AL pitching leaderboards to confirm this theory. After Friday nights games\, the Indians led the AL in strikeouts with 158 (one ahead of the Yankees 157). The AL average was 125. The team ERA however\, is a more robust 3.88 (league average 3.98). Since its 2015 and not 1985 though\, lets dig a little deeper on that one and note that the Indians have the 2 nd best Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) in the AL at 3.25\, and that 0.63 disparity is the 2 nd highest in the AL\, behind the fellow strikeout-heavy NYY. The Indians pitchers are (again) controlling what they can control\, but the defense isnt picking them up. If this sounds like a familiar story\, it should\, as the 2014 Indians led the AL with a 3.42 FIP but were tied for 6 th with a 3.56 ERA. So how do we fix this? How do we take advantage of what could be the best top to bottom (especially if TJ House can right the ship) pitching staff in the league? Well\, it just so happens that I have a plan:       1.   Call up James Ramsey to replace Little Jerry Sands. Ramsey\, unlike Sands\, can play all three outfield positions and will prevent any future situations where Mike Aviles plays CF. Hes a better defender than Murphy\, and should be able to hold his own at the plate.       2.   Swap out Jose Ramirez for Francisco Lindor. Ramirez has been OK at short this year\, but his range factor and defensive runs saved are both down from 2014 (small sample size alert). Combining those stats with years of scouting evaluations that suggest Ramirez will be at best an average shortstop pushes this one over the top for me. Ramirez can go back to AAA and play SS\, 2B and 3B\, then come back in a couple of months and take over the Mike Aviles role. Meanwhile\, Lindor takes over at SS and immediately becomes a plus defender at short\, shoring up a shaky infield D even if he cant do much with the bat at the outset. Ramirez is hitting .204/.245/.286 right nowcan Lindor really do much worse than that?       3.  At some point in mid-late May\, if Lonnie Chisenhall still isnt hitting\, call up Gio Urshela to play 3B. Even after hitting his first HR of the season on Friday against the Tigers\, Chiz was hitting a paltry .204/.245/.306. That includes a .167/.212/.300 line against southpaws. Hes been better in the field this year (in a small sample)\, but came in at -1.5 WAR in the field in 2014. Urshela could be an elite defender at 3B\, and even if he manages a .550 OPS hed at least be giving the offense the same help that Chisenhall has provided this year. As an added bonus\, Urshela hits right handed\, which would help settle some of the villagers with pitchforks lining up outside of Chris Antonettis house demanding a less lefty-heavy lineup. Will any of these moves actually happen? Probably not in the near-term\, especially with Urshela just coming off the DL for AAA Columbus this past week. But something needs to be done to improve the defense before its too late. The Indians cannot win the AL Central in April/May\, but its possible that they could lose it if this skid lasts much longer. Whats funny to me is that they Indians very quickly recognized that they had a more talented pitcher in AAA (Salazar) who could take a rotation spot from a guy who was scuffling out of the gate (McAllister)\, and immediately made a move to fix it. That move has proven effective thus far\, with Salazar making two superlative starts\, going 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA and 21 K in 13 innings. Why the teams brain trust can act so quickly to fill a hole in the rotation but cant seem to do the same for the defense is baffling to me. Hopefully a fix comes sooner rather than later. Its a long season and this is still a very talented baseball team\, but the defense could again prove to be the Achilles heel that keeps them for making a run deep into October. With all that being said\, Mike Petriello of Fangraphs ran an interesting article earlier this week suggesting that the Indians defense might not be as bad as the numbers would indicate early this season. The Indians rank 28 th in baseball with -12 defensive runs saved\, but -7 of those come directly from the pitcher position. Thats ridiculously high\, the worst in all of baseball. As Petriello explains: 24 of the 30 teams are within a relatively narrow -2 to 2 range\, simply because its so early and no ones had the time to be that bad. But Clevelands pitchers have dragged down the overall team score to such a degree that if we looked only at non-pitcher DRS\, theyd be tied with the Pirates at 23rd. Not that ranking 23 out of 30 in anything is something to be proud of\, but when youre coming from as far back as this group was last year\, youll take what you can get. ~ snip~ What we know\, certainly\, is that the defensive numbers arent perfect\, especially this early. What we know\, even more certainly\, is that defense has been an ongoing issue for this team for a few years. Right now\, its just too simple to look at close to last place in DRS and make the judgement of a disaster. Pitchers and minor leaguers and out-of-position infielders are making that look worse than it needs to be. Its not the same thing as having a playoff-caliber defense\, though. Not the same thing at all. So the defense\, while not great\, has been better than last season. Its still not where it needs to be\, but if the AAA cavalry can come up and improve the overall profile even more\, that could be enough to vault the Indians back into contention in the AL Central. The starting pitching is going to give them a chance in virtually every game this season\, and the lineup should come around eventually. The big question mark remains the D\, and thats something that can be improved with cheap\, young\, internal options. While the majority of Clevelanders were busy letting their blood boil over an idiotic column from an idiot (Dan Shaughnessy\, who I will not link to here under any circumstances and that rule was in place before last weeks travesty of a column)\, there was another Boston reporter who was writing a complementary column about Cleveland\, and the Indians in particular. Baseball Prospectus Brian Joiner took a nice look at the Indians roster construction in the context of how Boston has torn down and rebuilt their roster over the past couple of years. Joiner is becoming quite the Clevleophile (I just made up a word\, go with it)\, having written the Indians section of the Baseball Prospectus Annual and in general having lots of nice things to say about both the city and team here on the North Coast: I did not write about the Indians because I love Cleveland\, but because I was asked to write about Cleveland. That was lucky. I love Cleveland\, starting with Major League\, duh\, and continuing to this day. I have gone to Cleveland for fun on several occasions\, and I have had such delirious good times that I have nothing but good things to say about it. ~snip~ Anyway\, this years Indians are a construction marvel. Nearly the entire starting roster spot is filled by a reasonably paid\, above-average baseball player in his prime. What the front office\, led by Chris Antonetti\, lacks in maneuvering room with its roster\, it makes up for in construction efficiency\, save for Nick Swisher and Michael Bourn\, the albatrii in the outfield. ~snip~ Its so simple that its brilliant\, and in a way it renders a lot of analysis  well\, not meaningless\, but certainly less dense. The Soxs rotation is one you could make from reading the stats on old baseball cards\, and the Indians have shown that if you get guys who are just good enough\, one of them might go from relatively anonymous starter to Cy Young Award winner\, and a second to => /Top/Shopping/Home_And_Garden/Accessories/Glas

* Mountainbike Militiamen Movement * Ride Free\, Whatever it Takes   * Subversion Site * You have found The Mountainbike Militiamen Movement Subversion Site. Here you have access to information you will need to "ride the apocalypse". If you are easily offended\, have a weak stomach\, or you are a politically correct vegisexual treehugger chi-chi boy technoweenie squid you better go cryin' home right now. This is the Mountainbike Militiamen Movement and we mean to ride even if we have to be mean to ride. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * The Mission Statement * I f you are easily offended or afraid of the truth (often the same thing) then you best go away\, youll only get hurt hanging around here. T he Mountainbike Militiamen Movement was formed by a handful of Mountainbikers from NEPA (North-Eastern Pennsylvania) strictly for their own amusement. Eventually it became a venue to spout off politically incorrect and libertarian rhetoric. Later the original mission expanded and became a force to resist and fight the dark-evil we mountanbikers face in everyday life. Some believe were dangerous right-wing militants who preach a scorched earth policy if the bastards wont let us ride. Others think were leftist-liberals hell-bent on a socialist bike wing of government responsible for "Tricycle to Cruiser" entitlements. It has been suggested that this is satiraclegood-natured tongue-in-cheek fun. You may draw your own conclusions\, (we know itll be difficult for some of you). While the open exchange of ideas is encouraged\, the Mountainbike Militia doesnt care what anyone else thinks\, and those that dont like it be damned. Now shut up and go for a ride. T he above statement is the earliest M*M*M* document known to exist. It was uncovered in a secret cache along with a 12 gauge shotgun made out of " water pipe and a 2 x 6 sometime in the late 90's.

Parking We have a limited number of parking spots in the front parking area of Metro Gymnastics. Our main parking lot is in the back of our building with an entrance at the far end. Please do not park in Platts spaces in the front lot before 5 pm or beyond the blue fence in back at anytime. Overflow parking is available across the street at the Church during peak times. Before Class If you have logged into your customer portal\, signed the policies page\, and paid tuition\, you do not need to stop at the desk when you arrive for class. Cubbies are available for gymnasts in the greeting area to store shoes\, extra clothes\, back packs\, water bottles\, etc. during class. We have the locker/changing rooms with additional cubbies. Dancers should go to the Dance Room viewing area. We suggest that all gymnasts/dancers use the restroom prior to class so that they will not miss out on the fun. Once your gymnast is ready for class they should sit on the edge of the blue floor to wait for class to begin. Gymnasts are NOT allowed to practice their skills at this time. Instructors will be in this area to greet you and your gymnast. Dancers must wait outside the dance room. When it is time to begin class\, an Instructor will call all of the gymnasts /dancers onto the floor to begin warm-ups. Viewing Area After your gymnast is settled into class\, gymnastics parents should to go upstairs to the viewing area or to the snack/homework area. Dance parents are welcome to watch class in the dance viewing area. If your gymnast/dancer is comfortable you may run an errand or go workout yourself. TV monitors are set-up in the gymnastics viewing area to aid in watching classes\, as well as play areas and homework tables for siblings. Please DO NOT let siblings RUN in these areas. Parents are not allowed on the floor. Greeting area is for drop off and pick up only. Chairs are not allowed on any of the landings leading to viewing area. During Class Every class begins with a group warm-up. Gymnastics Rec and Mini-Mover classes held at the same hour do warm ups together. This may include running\, jumping and/or dancing\, followed by stretching to prepare the gymnasts for class. At the conclusion of warm-ups\, the gymnasts are divided into their specific classes and they rotate to the gymnastics events with their teachers. After Class Upon completion of the class the gymnasts/dancers will be brought back to the greeting area. Instructors must release children directly to an adult. If you have any questions about the class\, this is a great time to speak to your Instructor. Congratulations for caring enough to invest in your childs future physical development. We are pleased you have chosen Metro Gymnastics Center for your child. We pledge to uphold our mission\, which is to provide a fun\, positive\, and self-esteem building environment for all children and adults who participate in any of our programs. This will be accomplished by:  Teaching children that they have self-worth. Keeping children safe and healthy. Helping children to love to learn. Helping children to learn physical skills. Metro Gymnastics Center was founded in March of 1990. That month we started out with approximately 60 students. Today we have grown to more than 1100 students.

Blackjack Arabians & Pintabians Home Stallions Reference Sire Mares For Sale Gallery Videos Links Contact Us Blackjack Arabians & Pintabians began in 1998 when we purchased a small farm with 21 acres\, hence the name 'Blackjack'. We are located 10 miles from Marshfield\, Wisconsin\, in a small town of Chili.

Bloodlines include Khemosabi\, Niga\, Bask\, Adhem\, Morafic\, Raffles\, Ansata Ibn Halima\, Niga\, Bey Shah\, and Preacher Man\, to name a few. Pintabians are horses with over 99% Arabian blood and have a tobiano pattern. Pintabians are a unique and rare breed\, which originated in 1992 as PHRI\, or Pintabian Horse Registry\, Inc. They are separate from other Pinto-Arabian registries in which there are certain qualifications that Pintabians must meet in order to be in this registry. For further questions regarding the PHRI\, please contact them at PHRI\, PO Box 360\, Karlstad\, MN 54732. Our emphasis here at Blackjack Arabians & Pintabians has been to breed for conformation\, disposition\, beauty\, style\, intelligence and versatility\, with the elusive black color as an added bonus.

With the memory of the only loss in team history fresh in their minds\, the Majestics layed the wood to the host Pride 12-0. From the opening kickoff\, the Majestics dominated Corvallis on all sides of the ball. The Tacoma defense kept the Pride at bay while the offense pushed the ball down the field. The Majestics finally put one up in the third quarter on a short yardage plunge from Michelle Greisheimer. "Hopper" later followed Avamua Tuala and Fa'atuiese Sesepesara for a score in the final stanza. Griesheimer's two runs proved to be enough as the Corvallis offense couldn't come up with enough muscle to move the ball. The defense stiffled the Corvallis attack holding them to 81 total yards. The shutout is the third on the year for the Majestics. The win puts Tacoma in sole posession of first place in the PNW division. The Majestics can clinch the title with a win next Saturday at home versus the Portland Shockwave\, whom the Majestics defeated 12-0 in Beaverton earlier in the year.

Bruce "Snake" Gabrielson Home Page - surfing - Huntington Beach Snake Bruce "Snake" Gabrielson's Surfing Page Welcome Yep it's me\, Bruce Gabrielson\, the 1960s Huntington Beach Snake\, still alive and charging the surf as best I can after over 55 years on a surfboard. If you're an old friend\, please email me. Otherwise\, say hi if you see me in the lineup in Maryland\, Delaware or in other parts of the world. This web site was first put on the net as an FTP messaging board in 1990 while I was working at Naval Research Labs using a blackmagic domain. To my knowledge it was the first Internet surfing website. I believe my book\, The Complete Surfing Guide for Coaches" was also the first full text book placed on the Internet about 1991 while I was researching bandwidth issues. Follow my regular postings on FACEBOOK We offer the only NSSIA accredited surf school with actual certified surfing instructors (not just certified CPR) in Maryland. Lessons going on now.

2003 Cricket World Cup - Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia 2003 Cricket World Cup From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from 2003 cricket world cup ) Jump to: navigation \, search 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup Logo of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003 Dates 9 February  23 March Administrator(s) International Cricket Council Cricket format One Day International Tournament format(s) Round-robin and Knockout Host(s) South Africa Zimbabwe Kenya Champions Australia (3rd title) Participants 14 Matches played 54 Attendance 626\,845 (11\,608 per match) Player of the Series Sachin Tendulkar Most runs Sachin Tendulkar (673) Most wickets Chaminda Vaas (23)  1999 2007  The 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup was the eighth Cricket World Cup \, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was co-hosted by South Africa \, Zimbabwe and Kenya from 9 February to 23 March 2003. This edition of the World Cup was the first to be played in Africa . The tournament featured 14 teams\, the largest number in the World Cup's history at the time\, playing a total of 54 matches. It followed the format introduced in the 1999 World Cup \, with the teams divided into two groups\, and the top three in each group qualifying for the Super Sixes stage. The tournament saw numerous upsets\, with South Africa \, Pakistan \, West Indies and England all being eliminated at the group stage (South Africa missed by 1 run after misreading the Duckworth-Lewis method rules). [ 1 ] England forfeited their match with Zimbabwe \, due to the political unrest in the country\, which ultimately enabled that team to reach the Super Sixes. Similarly\, New Zealand forfeited their match with Kenya \, due to security reasons which enabled the latter to reach the semi-finals\, the only non- Test playing nation to do so. Another shock wave came two days after the tournament had started\, when Shane Warne \, at the time one of the game's leading spinners\, was sent home in disgrace after testing positive for a banned substance.

The 10 Test playing nations automatically qualified for the tournament including the recently appointed member Bangladesh \, while Kenya also qualified automatically due to their full One Day International status. The other three spots were filled by the top three teams in the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada \, which served as a qualifying tournament. These teams were\, respectively\, the Netherlands \, Namibia and Canada . This was Namibia's World Cup debut\, while the Netherlands and Canada were both appearing in the tournament for the second time\, having previously appeared in 1996 and 1979 respectively. The format used in the 1999 World Cup was retained\, with the 14 teams divided into two groups of seven\, and the top three from each group qualifying for the Super Sixes stage\, carrying forward the results they had achieved against other qualifiers from their group. The top four teams in the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals\, and the winners of those matches contested the final.

Putting together a championship drive is tough. Ask anyone who was lucky enough to come out on top and they likely will tell you its a daunting task. That isnt lost on Mark Winterbottom. But\, to see him week in and week out you wonder if ever fazes. He is what many call a racing machine. Mark captured his 9th A&B Tire Pro Eliminator championship this year in dramatic fashion. Yet\, even when he was locked into a tight\, four-way battle with brothers Jared Kinson and Jason Mazzotta\, and long time friend Joe Silva\, Mark kept his cool. Read More: Mark Winterbottom A Tale of Two Knights It doesnt come as a startling revelation that capturing a championship in any category at New England Dragway is the result of determination\, skill and hard work. This years Indy Auto Parts Super Pro Champion Ray Knight is the epitome of those attributes. Ray has been part of the New England Dragway racing community for decades\, recognized by his peers as one of the toughest drivers on the track. But\, if you ask him about the most thrilling aspect of this years hard fought battle you will not hear stories about margins of victories measuring in the ten-thousandths or near perfect reaction times. Instead he will tell you its the opportunity to share the podium with his son Steven who captured the E.C.O.P.E. Junior Dragster crown.

Several unique\, tricky holes feature water hazards ranging from meandering creeks to small ponds fronting greens. Test your skill on Hole 18\, one of Kansas Citys greatest water holes. This beautiful par three with an elevated tee box and island green requires great accuracy and distance control. Due to the layout of the course\, an 18 hole round of golf at Oak Country normally takes only 3 to 4 hours to play. With two par fives\, eight par fours\, and eight par threes\, you will use every club in your bag  but not a lot of your time. The course is less congested\, as well as less expensive\, than most of Kansas Citys pricey public courses because we are 15 miles from the metro area. That means you normally dont have to be paired up with other golfers if you dont want to be\, and you wont have a marshal pushing you around the golf course the whole round! New ownership in 1997 has implemented significant course improvements each year. Some of which include fully irrigated fairways\, paved cart paths\, larger and better conditioned tee boxes\, and greens that are in excellent shape. All of this combined with our exceptional personalized service and inexpensive rates makes Oak Country the best golfing value in the Kansas City area. Book your tee time online or call 913-583-3503. Course News We are now running 10% off on memberships! Unlimited golf with cart included for $58 a month Seniors or $61 a month Regulars! Our Wednesday night Men's League starts March 11th. No commitments\, just call in the Wednesday's you can play. This is a very fun and laid back 9 hole league. 4 person scramble(call in a team\, a twosome or just yourself) 5:30 pm Shotgun Start $15 for golf and cart and $3 kitty to be paid out to winning teams $1 Beers and .50 Soda Local Weather Oak Country Club | 8800 Scott Drive\, DeSoto\, KS 66018 | 913-583-3503 Copyright  2015 Oak Country Club All Rights Reserved. => /Top/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Hertfordshire/Welwyn_Garden_City/Recreation_And_Sport

Welcome to AYSO Region 104 Serving Albuquerque\, New Mexico Since 1978 Welcome to AYSO Region 104 serving the youth of Albuquerque\, New Mexico since 1978. We are the largest recreational youth soccer organization in town\, with hundreds of local volunteers and about 2500 soccer players ranging from 4 to 19 years of age. The American Youth Soccer Organization set out in 1964 to accomplish two goals. First\, to promote soccer to American youth. If you've driven around Albuquerque lately and seen the number of parks filled with soccer players\, you can see that goal has been accomplished. Second\, to improve the way youth sports are conducted. AYSO wants to change the traditional youth sports paradigm where some kids never get to play and the only communication between coach and players involves the command "Drop and give me 20." How does AYSO accomplish that? Our mission is to develop and deliver quality youth soccer programs in a fun\, family environment based on AYSO's Six Philosophies. News Weather Events News Congratulations to Aaron Luce HUGE CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES to Aaron Luce for successfully becoming our newest AYSO National Board Member. That's right our very own Regional Commissioner was just elected to the AYSO National Board of Directors. We our so proud of you Aaron!! Section 12 Supercamp Coming to Albuquerque June 19-21\, 2015 The Section 12 Super Camp is the perfect place for volunteers to get the training they need for upper level certifications. Those hard-to-find classes for coaches\, referees\, instructors\, and management will be available. Deadline for registration is June 1\, so don't hesitate\, sign up today! 1000 Minutes to Better Soccer Improve Your Soccer - Enjoy a Party! Attention all players: Do you want to get a party\, recognition\, and a cool shirt just for increasing your soccer skills? Then join the AYSO 1000 minutes program! Any player from U5 to U19 is encouraged to join. What is the 1000 minutes program? Click here for more information. Coaches\, get your players off to a good start for the season by explaining the 1000 Minutes program and encouraging them to participate. You can give them suggestions for things to work on during their individual practice\, or you can have them download the 1000 Minutes Manual and work on foot skills. A little practice goes a long way! Field Markers Not Just Magic I'll bet you thought field marking happened by magic; illusive fairies descend on the fields at night and paint lines so we can play soccer. Well\, it's something like that. It is our dedicated corps of volunteer field markers\, often unseen and unacknowledged\, who make sure our fields are properly marked for each game. They battle the elements and the city's mowing and watering schedule for the players. So if you happen to see someone paining lines on our fields\, take a minute to shake their hand and say\, "Thanks!" And if you'd like to volunteer to be a field marker\, please e-mail the Field Marking Administrator . He will set you up with equipment and training. Injury Forms Important Reminder for Coaches Coaches\, remember that if a player ever gets injured at a practice or a game\, you are required to fill out an incident form and turn it in to the Safety Director within 24 hours. If you have questions about how to fill out the form\, please contact the Safety Director. For more information about the Soccer Accident Insurance\, see the information in the Parents section. Safe Haven Training Training to Keep Volunteers and Children Safe In an effort to protect all of our players and volunteers\, AYSO requires all volunteers who will be working directly with the children to take our Safe Haven class. All coaches\, assistant coaches and referees are required to take the class. Region 104 implements this policy by requiring new volunteers to take the Safe Haven class from a certified instructor. Volunteers are required to take this class once. The best bet for this training is the Annual Coach and Referee Meeting. New referees who miss the Annual Coach and Referee Meeting can get their Safe Haven training as part of their referee clinic. If you are a coach or assistant coach who has never taken the Safe Haven course before\, and you miss the annual meeting\, you must attend one of the Safe Haven classes shown on the training schedule. Sandia Volunteer Service Awards "Sandia Serves" Attention Sandia National Laboratories Employees - Your Volunteering Efforts May Result in Funding for AYSO! Sandia National Laboratories has a tradition of recognizing the volunteer support of its employees. Realizing that there are many employees involved in a wide variety of civic activities outside of work\, they have developed the Community Service Awards program\, called "Sandia Serves"\, to provide financial support for employee involvement. Sandia National Laboratories employees volunteering 100\, 250 or 500 hours to AYSO in a calendar year are eligible to participate.

News (see newsletters page for past President Pens) President's Pen - 20 May 2015 The games on the weekend  In what was a very wet weekend\, the boys battled the elements with UWA (see our facebook photos) which proved to be an arm wrestle from about half time. From the side line UWA seemed to have come to the game with a good game plan\, excellent short corner plays and equal fitness with our men. Whilst we proved we can match it with the best\, the game plan devised by the Melville coaches which was equally as good as UWA's\, was not totally adhered to and combined with\, sometimes the smallest of errors cost us dearly. The truth is this was a game played by two very good teams and Melville lost 43. Welcome to our new striker and sometimes mid fielder Alex Wenn who scored the first goal. I still see positives and expect this team to keep improving. Especially if they are supported by the elder statesmen of the club like on Sunday in the change rooms. For the Top Squad Women's game the weather worsened further with torrential type down pour\, which forced the TDs to halt the game at half time. This was a bit of blow for the Melville ladies who were already up 20. However\, it was the fairest decision. It looks like our ladies will have to play the second half Tuesday 26 May\, 7:00pm at Duracraft Stadium Turf . We did look solid up until the stoppage though. My sincere apologies to these two wonderful players Renee Taylor and Mathilda Carmichael for calling the flick wrong in last week's article. Renee got the flick\, I am blind and so is the person who was sitting next to me. Good luck ladies when you play the second half. There were many other Melville games on around the metropolitan area from juniors through to seniors. They all experienced this weather and these tough conditions. Well we definitely knew we were alive and I hope you all won or at least had a good game. This is what our great sport is all about and sometimes character building takes the front seat so to speak. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our many sponsors. Some are advertised in The Pride and all are advertised on our web page and in our bulletin. These generous corporate citizens give us funds to support our club. While you dear members may not buy from these sponsors if there is a product or service you require could you as a minimum at least give them a chance to provide a quote. In most cases you will be pleasantly surprised. Always please mention you are from Melville Hockey they will give you a great deal and we will get the recognition for supporting them as they support us. I am sorry to report the documents supporting our request for portable change room additions are still with the City of Melville waiting for the Planning Dept as I understand it to either approve or recommend some changes required. I hope we can use them this season but more experienced people than I advise that this process is normal and drawn out. Just some club house keeping and updates as bullet point comments: Uniform Panel is now working into Phase two of the uniform change for the club and progressing to member uniforms and the extra paraphernalia type garments which go along with this change. That is brought about by our lead supplier Canterbury progressing successfully to the next level of the contract. If you can help we are now desperate for some volunteers to be supervisors in the Kitchen. If you can help please contact Maureen Welten or Graeme Coleman m: 0414441490. If you have a spare car hanging around in reasonable but not perfect condition we really need to give one of our import players a loaner for the season. If we are so lucky please contact me on Mob: 0418 734860. See you at the club. Gary Bowater  Melville City Hockey Club  President. We are looking for a 6 x 4 box trailer to fit the portable on. Steve McEntee has let us use his trailer previously\, but we need to have a permanent fix for the bar. If anyone has an unused trailer they would kind enough to donate to the club\, please contact Graeme Coleman .

Several poet-athletes had the opportunity to perform early this season at an event for Social Venture Partners during which Cowell and Eagleton students learned from professional spoken word artists and shared brand new poems with the crowd. On September 29th Denver joined nine other SCORES cities in attempting to break the Guinness World Record for most people dribbling a soccer ball at one time.

Grow becomes the eighth Carleton mens basketball player to earn D3hoops.com all-region recognition\, and is the first ever Knight to earn Rookie of the Year honors.  March 6\, 2015 McSparron\, Grow & England Pick Up MIAC Basketball Awards The ability to impact the game at both ends of the court earned Carleton College senior Shane McSparron a spot on both the 2014-15 MIAC Mens Basketball All-Conference Team and the All-Defensive Team. The conference coaches also voted Carletons rookie forward Kevin Grow to the MIACs All-First Year Team. February 21\, 2015 McSparron and Grow Pace Knights in Season Finale Saturdays season finale loss at Bethel University closed one chapter for the Carleton College mens basketball team and gave a further glimpse into the programs future. Senior Shane McSparron capped his collegiate career with a 17-point effort in the 64-60 setback\, while rookie Kevin Grow posted his eighth double-double of the year as he recorded career- and game-highs of 20 points and 16 rebounds. February 18\, 2015 Tianen Chen Provides Scoring Spark as Knights Pull Away from Saint Marys The most potent scoring option as of late for the Carleton College mens basketball team is not a member of the starting lineup. Tianen Chen scored his season-high 22 points off the bench to spark the Knights to a 75-59 victory over Saint Marys University. Tonight's effort come on the heels of his game-high 18 points in Monday's victory. February 16\, 2015 Bench Lifts Knights to Win Versus Concordia Led by sophomore Tianen Chen \, who poured in a game-high 18 points\, the reserves for the Knights provided a boost as the Carleton College mens basketball team rallied for a come-from-behind 51-49 victory over Concordia College. Chen was 7-of-10 from the field\, 4-of-6 at the charity stripe\, and pulled down a team-best seven rebounds. February 14\, 2015 Cold Shooting Dooms Knights at Saint Johns Kevin Grow matched his season highs with 14 points and 12 rebounds in posting the seventh double-double of his rookie season. That performance was not nearly enough\, however\, as the Carleton College mens basketball team shot only 25.9 percent in dropping a 69-45 decision at Saint Johns University.

Dan Shanoff skip to main | skip to sidebar Dan Shanoff And the new hotness is... Quickish! Monday\, April 20\, 2015 Tim Tebow and the Philadelphia Eagles Previously\, on Dan's obsession with Tim Tebow: 1\,000+ posts about the Tebow phenomenon from 2009-2012 at TimTeblog.com . With that as context\, a handful of thoughts about Tebow signing with the Eagles : *Chip Kelly is smarter than you\, armchair NFL expert. From the start\, Tebow has needed a coach who is innovative (and fearless) enough to deploy him in individual high-leverage situations. *That means on the goal line\, 4th/3rd/2nd/1st-and-short and as a 2-point conversion specialist (which might just become the next important NFL position). *I think that "QB continuity" -- that a starting QB has to play every single snap\, otherwise his fragile mind and team chemistry would implode -- is more likely orthodox pap than not. *I hope Kelly's intention is to test out the potential of that as a schematic inefficiency -- at a minimum\, I love the idea of the 2-point conversion specialist. *There is no downside to bringing him in\, if you don't care about the media hysteria (and Kelly doesn't). *Peter King will define a lot of the conventional wisdom on this: "Lets be real about what this is: Its a trial. Its a chance. Its a coach who doesnt care about the distraction of having Tim Tebow in his camp\, because he thinks Tebow might help his team." *Sports media pre-emptively complaining about the media coverage is slightly disingenuous: For starters\, a lot of fans genuinely care (out of curiosity\, schadenfreude or other). *And\, consequently\, it's worth pointing out that Tebow coverage generates a ton of online traffic (or TV/radio ratings) -- I don't see anyone sending those page views back. *Good perspective from Adam Schefter: "Let's stop with this Tim-Tebow-in-Philly-is-a-media-circus" idea. The whole league is a media circus." *Related: I'll wager that Tebow's Eagles jersey is a Top 5 seller for the NFL in May\, right up there with Winston\, Mariota\, Cooper and Gurley. *Curious: He can't wear No. 15 (retired by the Eagles for Steve Van Buren) or No. 5 (retired for Donovan McNabb). This is new territory. Available QB options are 9\, 11\, 12\, 17 or 18. *May just need to dust off TimTeblog.com for this run. -- D.S.

Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Wednesday\, April 15\, 2015 4/15 Justified Quickie Terrific series finale for Justified last night \, which finishes its run as one of the best TV dramas of all time. I'd put it in my personal Top 10 of the "post-Sopranos" era. Last night after it was over\, I tried to force-rank my list\, but it was too hard\, so here are 10 that make the cut\, in no particular order: Breaking Bad\, Justified\, The Shield\, The Wire\, The Americans\, GOT\, Friday Night Lights\, Battlestar Galactica\, Deadwood and... I'm going to leave that 10th spot open\, recognizing that I have yet to list Mad Men or Sopranos or Lost or Oz. The Americans and GOT\, of course\, are still ongoing -- it's a testament to both (particularly The Americans\, which I particularly enjoy) that they crack the list before their full run is even close to done. Otherwise: Pretty compelling final night of regular-season NBA coming up tonight. Going to dip my toe back into daily writing\, btw... -- D.S.

Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Monday\, February 02\, 2015 Monday 2/2 Super Bowl Hangover Quickie *The decision not to give the ball to Marshawn Lynch is the worst play call in the history of pro football. *It's been a while since I went full-blown "instant history/hysteria\," so it's nice to stretch my legs a bit. (That makes me more productive than Marshawn Lynch on the Seahawks' last offensive play of the season.) *The justification for the "Worst. _____. Ever." siren is the combination of the stakes (Super Bowl championship)\, the moment (come-from-behind TD\, virtually the final play of the game\, coming after one of the greatest catches in NFL history) and the context (would have denied the Pats a title)\, the context (would have won a back-to-back title for Seattle) and the context (Lynch is the NFL's best RB). *It's not enough to say "Worst play call in Super Bowl history" -- because it is the Super Bowl\, that makes it vastly bigger than if the play call happened in\, say\, Week 6 (or even an earlier playoff round). It is the context that justifies the superlative. *Looking for a reasonable/rational defense of the play call? Vox outlines a good one \, but it comes with a worthwhile caveat about over-thinking it. (Let's also say that Malcolm Butler made a phenomenal play -- if that ball drops for an incompletion\, it's very likely Lynch runs it in on one of the next two plays\, and the history of the NFL is altered. That Butler was an undrafted rookie makes it all the more incredible.) (Update: As always\, read Bill Barnwell for a measured take on the situation .) *All in all\, it was as entertaining of a Super Bowl as you could have asked for. *Postscript: The ads. It was basically a given that Budweiser would run away with the ad title \, but improbable that Nationwide would be the ad "everyone is talking about\," if only because of how grim it was. Personal favorite: Always' #LikeAGirl ad. (Notable: There were a LOT of "dad ads" -- I liked the Toyota Camry one. The Nissan one didn't speak to me at all.) -- D.S. Posted by Dan Shanoff at 2/02/2015 09:40:00 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Tuesday\, January 13\, 2015 Tuesday 1/13 Ohio State Champs Quickie *First of all: I was totally wrong about Ohio State's worthiness for the college football playoff. Full stop. *Urban Meyer is a Hall of Fame strategist and motivator. Obviously\, I loved him when he was at Florida. I didn't sour on him like many Florida fans when he ended up at OSU -- I'm a long-time OSU-loather\, so I disliked his location\, not the coach. Also\, you just knew he'd have OSU in position to win a title sooner rather than later -- ... yup. Three career titles is just a start\, and there is no reason why Ohio State won't win next year\, too. Prohibitive favorite\, no matter who is at QB.... *But that is a fascinating question\, isn't it? Cardale Jones had arguably the greatest season by a starting QB in the history of college football. He certainly had the best three-game stretch\, a cannon-armed\, fridge-sized load (ESPN's Tommy Tomlinson wins\, for dubbing him a "vending machine"). He was the perfect QB for the past two games for Ohio State. *And yet! JT Barrett was all-Big Ten (even better than preseason all-Big Ten QB Braxton Miller) and is arguably a better fit for Meyer's offense than Jones. Not "arguably" -- when given a choice earlier this season\, Meyer picked Barrett over Jones and didn't look back. *Returning to a favorite theme of mine: Jones should turn pro \, not just because he can (which is always a pretty good reason to do it)\, but because he should -- he isn't getting more NFL-prepared from another season at Ohio State (and certainly not if he is subordinated to second-string). He will be a better NFL QB if he is taught by NFL QB coaches and participating in an NFL system. At the very least\, he will make some money\, both from his NFL contract and the inevitable endorsement deals that will come from being a favorite of LeBron James. And\, oh yeah\, he seems to have the biggest arm in college football -- even if no one knew it until a few weeks ago. (He won't turn pro\, obviously\, but it's a very interesting discussion\, I think.) *In the end\, the inaugural College Football Playoff was a raging success. Just enough controversy about the selection process\, which then played out epically with the controversial 4th team steamrolling the reigning SEC juggernaut\, then the reigning nouveau-riche program (featuring the Heisman winner and presumptive No. 1 overall pick of the NFL Draft)\, which itself had steamrolled the unbeaten defending champs and its own former Heisman winner/presumptive top-ish draft pick.) *Looking ahead to the 2015 playoff foursome\, an early prediction: Ohio State\, Oregon\, Alabama\, TCU. -- D.S.

Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Friday\, January 02\, 2015 Friday 1/2/15 College Football Playoff Hangover Quickie The inaugural college football playoff went better than I think anyone could have ever imagined: *The defending (unbeaten) champ was vanquished in a fashion we haven't seen in a college football championship situation in 20 years (Tommie Frazier runs over Florida in 1995). *The dynastic program (and conference) was vanquished by a team that many/most argued didn't even deserve to be in the field\, coached by a conference ex-pat. *It's as much -- possibly more -- about the losers (Florida State\, Alabama) as it is about the winners (Oregon\, Ohio State). Both games were amazing to watch. *As many have pointed out\, in the absence of the 4-team playoff\, we would have gotten FSU and Alabama for the title -- this makes last night's outcomes even more amazing. *And now we have "How Do You Stop the Ducks?" versus "Sure\, Keep Doubting the Buckeyes." *It seems like it'll be Oregon in a rout -- the inevitable conclusion to the Ducks' manifest destiny. But if Ohio State can out-muscle Alabama\, there is certainly a "why not?" to the game. *And we have the end of the mythology of the SEC -- certainly the 2006-2014 version. Critics of the SEC's haughtiness will point to New Year's Day 2015 for years. *And we have the start of a glorious new era in college football\, with a playoff system that produced drama-infused games and highly entertaining outcomes. *I'll give the last word to Spencer Hall\, who had a wonderful morning-after homily about what happened last night \, concluding: "This all happened in the same day\, and let's never do this any differently\, college football." -- D.S.

Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Tuesday\, December 23\, 2014 14 Great Sportswriting Reads for 2014 Back during the Quickish Era\, my favorite thing was the year-end "best-of" sportswriting list -- the first one was in 2011 ("Quickish 11 for '11")\, and it proved pretty popular ... not to mention enjoyable to prepare. You can't find that original list anymore\, but the tradition lives on in '14. And the underlying sentiment extends into another year: Sportswriting has never been better . To be sure: "14" is an absurd\, artificial constraint; there are many more worthy entries*\, as my overworked browser tabs and gut-busting Pocket account indicate. Still\, here are 14 of my favorite pieces of sportswriting this year -- listed alphabetically by author . Katie Baker\, Grantland : "The Cold Never Bothered Him Anyway"  Chris Ballard\, SI.com : "Twilight the Saga"  Jane Coaston\, EDSBS : "On Women and Sports"  Bryan Curtis\, Grantland : "Travonte's Party"  Steven Godfrey\, SB Nation : "Meet the Bag Man"  Spencer Hall\, SB Nation : "The Istanbul Derby"  Amanda Hess\, ESPN.com : "Just Cheer\, Baby"  Greg Howard\, Deadspin : "The Big Book of Black Quarterbacks" Sarah Marshall\, The Believer : "Remote Control"  Brian Phillips\, Grantland : "Diamonds in the Rough"  Paul Sonne and Anton Troianovski\, Wall Street Journal : "Here's the Skinny on NBC's Olympic Latte Secret"  Louisa Thomas\, Grantland : "Together\, We Make Football"  Wright Thompson\, ESPNFC.com : Sketches from the World Cup  Don Van Natta\, ESPN.com : "Jerry Football"  * - Again\, "14" is a dumb constraint and I lament the things I don't include as much as I enjoy the things I do. Here are a few under "Also Receiving Votes": Chris Ballard\, SI: "Haverford Oops" Flinder Boyd\, Newsweek: "The Birdman's Vengeful Ghost" Flinder Boyd\, FoxSports.com: "Run and Gun" Jeremy Collins\, SB Nation: "13 Ways of Looking at Greg Maddux" Kathy Dobie\, GQ: "The Undefeated Champions of Defeat City" Jason Fagone\, Grantland : "Dropped"  => /Top/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing/College_And_University/United_States

Sponsored by Team Outlawed This site is dedicated to Team Outlawed of Indiana. Sign My Guestbook View My Guestbook UPDATED DATES 8/17 @ 5:15 PM We would like to thank you for visiting. I would like to start by telling how we started playing paintball. Our team started playing in the spring of 1998. There were 4 of us that played on a regular basis. All four started with our Wal-Mart bought Brass Eagle Talons and Brass Eagle paint. It was fun for us to get out and goof off. The first semi automatic guns we ran into were from some friends from Bloomington. I invited them down to where we play. James had a Spyder and Frank had a Automag. We were impressed at the sight of them and were leary of playing them at first. For our first introduction to that firepower\, we got a royal spanking. The first game\, the semi's\, wiped all of us out without any of us getting a shot off. After that first game we split up and began our learning of the paintball game.Since that day we have all upgraded to semi's and have done very well for ourselves. We are now playing in various tournaments around the state. One funny story we like to tell from that day is as follows: Whenever someone was tagged and sitting on the porch they would hear something funny.Poop...Poop...Poop...The sound of our Talons firing. The funny part was what followed after. You would hear Poop...Poop...Poop... then imediately after would be a Pop.Pop.Pop.Pop. from the semis cutting us down. If that doesn't sound funny I guess you should have been there. Needless to say since we needed more firepower Ghost and I built paintball cannons which shoot up to 50 balls at a time.(For our senario games.) Team Outlawed fears no team for one simple reason: If that team is better we will learn from them. To improve you must push yourself to higher and harder goals. Our team realizes this and is always up to any challenge from any team. All we expect is good and fair play. Our team will never cheat. That is bad on the team and disrespectful to whomever we play. If you are somewhat local\, within 80 miles\, give me a mail and we will set up a date to skirmish against one another. We love to play a good game against others.

Jai-Alai HOME HOW TO PLAY HISTORY TRIVIA FRONTONS Dania Jai-alai Fort Pierce Jai-alai Hamilton Downs Miami Jai-alai Ocala Jai-alai Orlando Jai-alai Texas Jai-alai BET NOW Jai-Alai Jai-alai is a ball game that originated in Spain's Basque region and is played in a three-walled court with a hard rubber ball that is caught and thrown with a cesta \, a long\, curved wicker scoop strapped to one arm. The game is called pelota vasca in Spain but the Western Hemisphere name of Jai-alai \, which is Basque for "merry festival"\, was given when it was introduced in Cuba. This was due to the fact that this game was played at festivals or fiestas in Spain's Pyrenees Mountains for hundreds of years. The game was then played in the open air with the walls of churches being used to bounce the ball on. Jai-alai is characterized by its fast playing pace\, in which a 125g ball (or pelota) covered with parchment skin can travel faster than 180 mph. The ball is volleyed by players wearing a wicker basket glove approximately 63 to 70 cm long. The glove\, called cesta-punta in Spanish and xistera in Basque\, was invented by the French Basque Gantchiqui Diturbide (also Gantxiki Iturbide) in the 19th century. The game of Jai-alai is popular in countries like Spain and Mexico where\, in some regions\, the game is played in almost every town and city. Jai-alai also spread out to such countries as mainland Brazil\, the Philippines\, Italy\, Indonesia\, China and Egypt. In the United States\, Jai-alai is quite popular among gamblers in Florida where it is used as a basis for pari-mutuel gambling. In fact\, professional Jai-alai in America originated at the Miami Fronton. World Jai-alai\, which is based in Miami\, has promoted the most extensive amateur Jai-alai program ever\, with a number of schools in Spain\, France and one in Miami\, Florida. Jai-Alai.info is your comprehensive guide to Jai-Alai. We also provide helpful information on  2005-2014 Jai-Alai.info => /Top/Regional/North_America/United_States/Vermont/Localities/R/Richford/Business_And_Econom

This initiative has been developed by Stephen Brosnan\, Juvenile Registrar Profile of: Johnny Kelliher John Mitchel's Senior Player From/To: 1958-1970 Honours Won: Minor County Championship Title 1958 Six Senior County Championship Titles 1959-1963 & 1966 Player Position: Goal Keeper\, Full Forward on the Minor team (Q): Tell me about the Minor title win in 1958? (A): "We played West Kerry in the final in the Austin Stack Park. At half time we had scored 6 points to no score for West Kerry. I played in the full forward position and scored 4 points on the day. The game ended John Mitchel's 12 points West Kerry no score. There was six of our team also playing on the Mitchel's Senior team". (Q): What has been your greatest accomplishment as a Mitchel's player? (A): "It was a great accomplishment in its self to get a place on the Mitchel's team. The Senior team of that era had some great footballers. For me it was the County Championship title win in 1966. We had no hope in the world of winning or at least we weren't given any by our critics. East Kerry had a star studded team and we beat them in the Final. It was also the end of an era for many of our players as they retired from football".

Pepper Ridge Miniature Horses United States of America English Seiten auf Deutsch Deutsch / German email Welcome to Pepper Ridge Miniature Horses\, USA Pepper Ridge is located in Odessa\, Florida where we have been raising exceptional double registered AMHA & AMHR miniature horses for over 20 years. Our horses are selectively bred and cared for\, each measuring under 34"\, having their individual feeding / training program and their own stall every night. We do not incorporate nor do we advocate over stressing our horses with excessive lunging\, blanketing\, vaccinating\, showing\, or sweating. Above all\, the use of synthetic hormones or steroids is not an option. We have chosen a more natural approach to the miniature horse industry\, such as selectively breeding in the qualities that we are interested in producing\, and using alternativetreatments in addition to conventional veterinary medicine. Therapies such as acupuncture\, homeopathy\, chiropractic\, and traditional Chinese herbs have been the norm for our farm (quite successfully) for many years\, with special thanks going out to our holistic veterinarian Dr. Peggy Fleming. Glory B Farm's Night Lite\, Our herd Sire As a result of the internet\, we have sold many superb AMHA miniature horses worldwide creating several life-long friendships. We invite you to a tour of our farm in person if you come to sunny Florida.

Renner Motorsports Sponsored by Renner Motorports is the creation of it's driver\, Dave Renner\, of Mason\, Ohio. If being a racer is a condition\, Dave certainly has it. He has raced everything from karts to bikes to stockers. He's turned only left\, he has turned right and left\, and also just gone straight on occasion. He has achieved success in all of his racing endeavors. Dave's career started at the early age of 3 in go-karts. Dave then moved on to dirt bikes. Since he grew up near Queen City Speedway it was a natural that he wanted to race at the track\, which is now closed. "I rode my bicycle to the track and rooted for Dave Jackson\, Gene Harsh and Glenn Allen\, but I had to be home by dark\, so I never got to see who won!"\, said Renner. Dave and boyhood friend\, Freddy Hall\, started helping Brent Robertson. Then with the help of Glenn Allen\, they built a mini for Freddy Hall. "We really didn't have a clue about the cost of racing\, we thought we were going to hit the track for $800." said Renner. After graduating from the University of Kentucky\, Dave started his racing career again. Dave started driving at Queen City in an old Dodge Daytona Sportsman car which had previously belonged to Dave Jackson. After Queen City closed Dave quenched his thirst for speed with some go-kart racing and a little drag racing\, however\, it didn't fill the void. After building a Firebird\, Renner returned to competition at Shady Bowl Speedway\, where he competed for 3 seasons. After that the fun continued at Kil-Kare Speedway. After achieving success at local short tracks like Shady Bowl and Kil-Kare\, the team's next assault was on the infamous 1/2 mile high banks of Winchester Indiana. 1997 brought a new opportunity for Dave and the Renner Motorsports team. After a year of construction and development work on the team's new #51 Nascar racer\, Dave and the team were optimistic about the upcoming season at Winchester Speedway. Renner commented\, "It's a new track\, a new car and a new motor combination\, but I know we're ready for the challenge. I hope to be a strong contender during the 98 season. Regardless\, I am sure of one thing\, it will be anything but boring." Renner Motorsports began working with sponsors\, who benefitted from the high degree of visibility that Dave and the car were now enjoying.  The new car featured a unique state of the art Rusty Foley Chassis\, based on a 108" Pontiac Grand Prix. Power roared from a 406 c.u.\, 14 to 1 Bobby Jacks Chevy. Most of the Nascar Super Stocks are based on a older\, larger G.M. chassis. The new Renner Motorsports car offered some distinct aerodynamic advantages\, but lost some advantage in the track width. However\, Renner Motorports thought that this was the wave of the future and looked for success after the bugs were worked out. The highlight of the 1998 season was winning the Anchor Glass feature on August 22. Dave commented: "We had a great season. We ran strong all year and we finished races." The AE Door Pontiac was a factor each and every race. "We've won a lot of races\, but to win at Winchester is no doubt the biggest win of my career." Sponsors:  AE Door Bob Williams Ford Smith Trailers Schaeffer's Specialized Lubricants  Bob's Braided Lines  County Line Mulch  Renner Transport  Valco Cincinnati In 1999 they moved into the ARCA super car series with optimism\, and eagerly sought the challenge of racing in this premier division. Renner Motorsports is always looking to the future with new goals and challenges\, and takes the plunge into a new series\, a new car\, and even several new crew members. The new car is a former Jeremy Mayfield #37 Ford Thunderbird\, Banjo Mathews chassis\, and a 730 HP RDI/SVO Ford engine built by Jeff Collin in Mooresville\, NC. Sponsors included AE Door\, Kings Ford\, Smith Trailers\, and Bob's Braided Lines. The team also acquired a Super Speedway car\, the former Cale Yarborough owned\, John Andretti driven Ford shown here. This car is being prepared to enable Dave to compete on ARCA's super speedway schedule as well as on the short tracks. This added venue will showcase the team and it's sponsors on a much larger scale than ever possible before. "Our goals for this year aren't to set the world on fire\, but to learn the new tracks\, and what the car wants to make it handle. We hope to qualify for all our races and run in the top 15\, and if we can sneak into the top 10 on occasion\, it would be a good year." Dave Renner and Renner Motorsports anticipate the challenges facing them. At this point Renner Motorsports will be running a 5 to 9 race schedule\, depending on corporate backing. The future looks bright for this new year\, and Dave will face it\, as always\, sideways\, and with the tires on fire. Dave is also the host of "Pit Talk" on WMOH 1450 AM. It is the only local 'call in' racing show in Cincinnati. WMOH is also a Motorsports Racing Network affiliate which carries all the NASCAR Cup races\, Truck races and the whole M.R.N. talk show schedule. You can listen and bench race with Dave every Thursday evening between 7 and 9 p.m. (The phone number for the show is 868-9664) To Contact Renner Motorsports: 309 Bainbridge Ct.

An early pit stop with radio trouble put Dave down three laps\, and from there he raced with\, and challenged\, many of the established names in this series. By the race end\, Dave had climbed back to fourteenth place\, a large achievement in this series. July 31\, 1999 Flat Rock Speedway \, Michigan\, Dave again qualified for the race. Another early pit stop\, again with radio trouble\, cost Dave three laps. Dave was climbing back through the field again\, when he was hit in the rear and the side\, and was spun to the infield\, which was still soaked from an earlier rain shower. Dave had to wait until a tow truck could pull him from the infield\, at which point he resumed a march through the field\, and finished 18th. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- => /Top/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union/Clubs_And_Teams/Europe/England/Bristo

Fund Raising Program - Youth Baseball - Benko Bat-a-thon - 888.446.1192 ....BATTER UP...BAT-A-THON 2011 SEASON IS OVER...NOW IS THE TIME TO PLAN FOR 2012. BAT-A-THON   clients average over $1000 per team with our fundraising system. That's $20K with 200 players\, $30K with 300 players. A few do $50K to $70K with around 400 players.   BAT-A-THON    clients are able to afford lighted fields\, the best equipment\, The best uniforms and the best training. BAT-A-THON    Others have imitated our fundraising system but none have figured out how to succeed like our clients do. BAT-A-THON    We can show you how to raise big bucks if you are a youth baseball organization with kids up to 12 years of age. benko@bat-a-thon.com  13500 Copper Bed Road Herndon\, Virginia 20171 1.888.446.1192 Fax 703.713.0877 Our larger BAT-A-THON  client organizations do generate $50k-$100k each year. They really are improving their fields\, adding lights\, providing the best equipment and even seem to be improving in post season play. Maybe it's the support and enthusiasm generated by the parents. Maybe it's the excitement of the kid's participating in the Tournament. We cannot take credit for our clients' wins and losses\, but we do take credit for providing the most effective fundraising system available. Can you imagine your board trying to decide what major projects to do\, instead of figuring out how to cut costs to meet budget?

PERHAPS Irishman hopes for minutes as Galaxy look to right things vs. Houston Robbie Keane has returned to training with the Galaxy and hopes to see minutes Friday against Houston. Linda Cuttone/Sports Vue Images The Galaxy got a load of good news ahead of Friday night's clash with the Houston Dynamo at StubHub Center: Robbie Keane is back. Complete story LA GALAXY RECENT NEWS RISING GALAXY SEE MIRROR IMAGE Real Salt Lake also gets healthier ahead of Western showdown The stoppage-time victory last week over the Houston Dynamo was a huge positive for the Galaxy's psyche\, especially with a healthier Robbie Keane playing so prominent a role. Now L.A. will look for successive wins for the second time this year\, and against a foe whose situation isn't all that different. A CORNER TURNED? Keane's return sparks Galaxy in best performance\, triumph over Houston The Galaxy already were playing their most free-flowing soccer of the season\, perhaps nothing to challenge the brilliance of last year's possession game\, but after what's been going on these past two and a half months\, it looked pretty good. KEANE MAKES A DIFFERENCE Gordon's stoppage-time strike lifts Galaxy past Dynamo Robbie Keane's return proved most profitable for the Galaxy\, who played their best match of the season -- even before their captain came on -- and claimed a last-minute victory from another Alan Gordon header. KEANE READY? PERHAPS Irishman hopes for minutes as Galaxy look to right things vs. Houston The Galaxy got a load of good news ahead of Friday night's clash with the Houston Dynamo at StubHub Center: Robbie Keane is back. 'NOT A GOOD SIGN' Makeshift Galaxy are awful in debacle at Orlando City After the Galaxy's worst performance this season\, a year in which they've been poor far more often than not\, Bruce Arena noted that their debacle Sunday evening in Orlando\, Fla.\, had better be an aberration. WORST OF THE WORSE Galaxy clobbered by Orlando City in poorest outing of 2014 The Galaxy have had some atrocious performances this season\, but nothing like Sunday's. MIRROR IMAGE Shorthanded Galaxy take on ailing Orlando City\, look to end road skid The Galaxy take their dozen-game winless streak away from home and lengthening injury crisis up against an expansion side that hasn't yet won on its ground and is missing just as many players -- more\, actually -- than they are. NOT GOOD ENOUGH Galaxy's best performance in weeks falls apart at FC Dallas The Galaxy put together their best performance in more than a month\, despite another makeshift lineup in response to an injury crisis and their third game in eight days and a new 4-1-4-1 formation.

The sport\, which is played socially and competitively in village halls and other community spaces\, does not require a permanent location as the portable mats are rolled up and stored when not in use. The sport is played by all ages\, sexes and abilities who can compete together. HSMBA is the organising body for short mat bowls in Herefordshire. We are affiliated to the ESMBA\, the governing body in England\, and we run leagues\, county teams and open competitions as well as generally promoting and developing the sport within the county. A good place to start for newcomers is our Introduction section where you can find out more about the game\, how to start playing or how to go about establishing a new club.

The Premier team were outclassed by a strong Kent side and lost 38- 2 but the A team took part in a thrilling encounter with Essex A which ended with the teams level at 20- 20 on points and 8- 8 on mat victories so the match had to be decided by a singles shoot- out. John Clapson\, Tim Rigden and Charlotte Kite each played a single end with Herefordshire losing 2- 1 and so losing the tie by the narrowest possible margin.

Johan Hedberg Johan Hedberg Photo taken from nhl.com press photo. Reprinted without permission. BORN: Leksand\, Sweden\, May 5\, 1973. HEIGHT: 5'11" WEIGHT: 180 pounds. CATCHES: Left. (Click on each section header to open (or to close) items in that section) WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING: "The Swedish goalkeeper was acquired prior to the March trade deadline almost as an afterthought. He ended up being the most important acquisition of the season. Hedberg vaulted into the postseason spotlight\, registering a .911 save percentage and 2.30 goals-against average in 18 playoff contests. Moose" makes spectacular saves look routine and plays with an overabundance of confidence. He must now prove he's for real. Hedberg will enter the season as the Penguins' No. 1 goaltender. He can't let his overnight success go to his head or he'll end up like Philadelphia's Brian Boucher (an overnight sensation two seasons ago) - on the bench." (The Sports Forecaster 2001-02\, p. 111) "Despite his many doubters\, Hedberg proved capable of becoming a true No. 1 goalkeeper with an outstanding 2001-02 campaign. Moose" finished fifth in the league in shots faced last season in front of a mediocre Pens squad. Furthermore\, he was at times dominant between the pipes\, registering six shutouts on the year. Occasionally\, Hedberg is prone to giving up a softy. However\, his overall play has greatly exceeded Pittsburgh management's expectations. If the Penguins have playoff aspirations in 2002-03\, they may have to give Hedberg even more ice time. Can he continue to withstand the heavy workload? Hedberg and Pens fans may find out soon." (The Sports Forecaster 2002-03\, p. 109) "The man called 'Moose' was thought to be headed back to Europe for good\, after a shaky stint with the Vancouver Canucks in 2003-04. Instead\, he'll back up Marty Turco in Dallas. Hedberg didn't live up to expectations as a starter in Pittsburgh - after a whirlwind debut in 2001 - but he's a decent second stringer." (The Sports Forecaster 2005-06\, p. 101) TRANSACTIONS: Selected by Philadelphia Flyers in ninth round (eighth Flyers pick\, 218th overall) of National Hockey League entry draft\, June 29\, 1994. Traded by Flyers to San Jose Sharks for seventh-round pick ( C Pavel Kasparik ) in 1999 entry draft\, July 6\, 1998.

Six times the Gophers have been crowned National Champions: 1934\, 1935\, 1936\, 1940\, 1941\, & 1960. In fact\, the 1934 team is still considered by many to be one of the best\, if not THE best\, college teams ever assembled. The school has certainly had its share of legendary head coaches\, such as Dr. Henry Williams\, Bernie Bierman\, and Murray Warmath. Greater still is the number of coaching giants who played their college ball at Minnesota: Gil Dobie\, Bud Wilkinson\, Biggie Munn\, and Bud Grant\, just to name a few. In addition\, few schools can match Minnesota's roll call of legendary players: Pug Lund\, Ed Widseth\, Herb Joesting\, Sonny Franck\, Bruce Smith\, Leo Nomellini\, Clayton Tonnemaker\, Paul Giel\, Sandy Stephens\, Tom Brown\, Bobby Bell\, Carl Eller\, and of course\, Bronko Nagurski. This page serves as a tribute to all of those through the ages who have helped make the Minnesota Golden Gophers one of college football's most storied programs. This page is in no way affiliated with the University of Minnesota nor its football program. => /Top/Sports/Basketball/Women/College_And_University/Ncaa_Division_I/Big_Ten_Conference/Iowa

Note on name spelling: Sesil Karatantcheva is Bulgarian. Bulgaria uses the Cyrillic alphabet. That's why the Bulgarian names are transliterated in Latin alphabet. Unfortunately there's no common transliteration table and what happens is that either every person decides how to transliterate his name or some journalists translitarate it. Very often the more common translitaration is different from the one written in the passport. And this is the case with the surname of Sesil. She's known as either Karatantcheva (used by WTA) or Karatancheva (on some Bulgarian English language media). Regardless of the transliteration it shoud be pronounced [ka:-ra:-'tan-che:-va:]. Her first name is transliterated as Sesil although some people might write it like Secile\, Cecile\, Secil. The way it should be prnounced is [se-'sil]. In Bulgarian language her name is  .

Grande Meadows Golf Course Grande Meadows Golf Club \, located on the Burin Peninsula\, is the most southerly course in the province. The completion of this project culminates years of hard work and dedication by local volunteers and is fitting testimony to their endeavour. Robert Heaslip\, a golf course architect from Ontario\, undertook the design and construction supervision. The course was officially opened in the spring of 1995 and has since matured beyond everyone's expectations. The greens have already been rated by "Golf Talk" among the best in the province. Moist and warm breezes from Fortune Bay are proving to be the ideal environment for a golf course development. Grande Meadows golf course is built on a peninsula of level land with the Great Garnish Barsway bordering five holes around the perimeter and ponds and marshland come into play on at least two more holes. The course requires deliberation on every shot and accuracy off the tee is more important than distance. To speed play\, all hazards\, ponds or marsh areas are considered lateral hazards. The bentgrass greens are very large\, fast and surrounded with strategically-placed sand traps and contoured mounds. The lush tee boxes are wide and long\, providing numerous tee placements. We are very proud to say that the course is always kept in first class condition by our excellent staff.

The Lovely Chamique Holdsclaw News Chamique News Last Games Articles Next Games Column Archives Facts Statistics Biography Multimedia Theater Gallery Interactive Poll Quiz Contest Feedback Special Site News Credits Links Literature Chamique Holdsclaw traded to Los Angeles Sparks 9/12/2004 9:00 PM By: Capital News 9 web staff 03/21/05 - Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) Washington Mystics Washington\, D.C. Washington Mystics General Manager Linda Hargrove announced today that the team has acquired Forward Delisha Milton-Jones from the Los Angeles Sparks as well as the 13th pick in the 2005 WNBA Draft for Forward Chamique Holdsclaw. We have a lot of confidence in Delisha and her abilities. Having won two WNBA championships\, she brings that experience as well as leadership to our team\, said Hargrove. She has the intangibles that will help us take the steps necessary to become a contender for the Eastern Conference Championship. In six seasons with the Sparks\, Milton-Jones averaged 30.4 mpg\, 11.4 ppg\, 6.0 rpg and 1.8 apg. She was a member of the Los Angeles team that won back-to-back championships in 2001 and 2002. In post-season play\, Milton-Jones averaged 34.4 mpg\, 12.8 ppg. 6.20 rpg.\, 2.5 apg.\, and 1.57 spg. In 2004\, Milton-Jones started 19 games for the Sparks where she averaged 9.8 ppg\, 4.7 rpg and 1.21 spg.\, before being sidelined for the rest of the season with a knee injury. A 61 forward from the University of Florida\, Milton-Jones was selected in the first round (fourth overall) in the 1999 WNBA Draft by the Los Angeles Sparks. In 1997\, she was named the SEC player of the year as well as the Wade Trophy winner. She also earned All-American honors from the Associated Press\, Kodak and Basketball Times. "We're extremely excited to acquire Delisha Milton-Jones\," said Mystics Head Coach Michael Adams. "Delisha brings championship experience to our roster and will provide leadership as we look to improve on last season's finish. While we are excited about adding Delisha to the roster\, we will certainly miss Chamique. In my first year as a head coach\, I feel very fortunate to have coached a player of the caliber of Chamique Holdsclaw. She will truly be missed by the Mystics organization and we wish her all the best." Chamique Holdsclaw was selected in the first round (first overall) of the 1999 WNBA draft by the Washington Mystics. In six seasons with the team\, she averaged 18.3 ppg\, 9.0 rpg and 2.5 steals. She was named the 1999 WNBA Rookie of the Year. "On behalf of the organization\, I would like to thank Chamique for her service to the Mystics\," said Washington Sports and Entertainment President Susan O'Malley. "Obviously\, Chamique went through a very trying time personally last season\, and we have attempted to support her in every way possible. When she asked us to consider trading her for a fresh start\, we felt it was best for everyone to honor that request. We wish only the best for Chamique both personally and professionally." I want to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to the Washington Mystics fans for their unwavering support\, kindness and loyalty during my six years with the team - - especially during the tough times of this past season. I know that I greatly benefited from my experiences in Washington which will help me both personally and professionally as I move on\, said Holdsclaw. Have you Read Chamique's Book? From a back lot in Astoria\, Queens\, to Rookie of the Year for the WNBA's Washington Mystics\, here is the exciting life story of the athlete some people have called "the female Michael Jordan." In her own words\, Chamique tells the inspiring story of her grandmother who raised her; the college basketball coach who challenged her; the fans who adore her; and her amazing success a an athlete who has changed the face of women' sports forever. Mystics stay alive\, Comets knocked out WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Mystics kept their playoff hopes alive Sunday\, while the four-time WNBA champion Houston Comets' dreams of a fifth trophy officially came to an end. Alana Beard overcame early foul trouble and scored 21 points as the Mystics (15-16) won their third in a row with a 75-63 victory over the Comets (12-18)\, who were eliminated from postseason contention. The Mystics are 2-0 since three-time All-Star Chamique Holdsclaw announced she would not return this season because of an undisclosed medical problem\, and 5-3 since in the eight games she's missed. The Comets lost four-time All-Star Sheryl Swoopes with 13:24 remaining in the first half when she sustained a left-eye contusion while battling Chasity Melvin and teammate Michelle Snow for a loose ball. Swoopes returned to the bench for the second half but did not play. "When you lose one of the best players in the game it affects the game\, but we have to find a way to overcome it\," Houston coach Van Chancellor said. "Washington found a way to overcome [the loss of] Chamique Holdsclaw and we need to do the same." "The bench play was big time today\," said Beard\, who picked up her third personal midway through the first half. "They did an awesome job in the first half keeping us ahead and they finished the game very strong." Mystics backup point guard Tamicha Jackson scored 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting. Reserves Aiysha Smith added six points and Coco Miller five. "Alana was in foul trouble so I was ready to get into the game\," Jackson said. "Our team chemistry has been great throughout the season and it has really shown in our play down the home stretch." Melvin added 11 points and Murriel Page had eight points and a team-high eight rebounds. The Mystics closed on a 6-0 run\, capped by Beard's layup with 34 seconds remaining. "If we continue to play as well as did today then we have a good shot at the playoffs\," Mystics coach Michael Adams said. Tina Thompson scored 17 points to lead the Comets\, who have lost four in a row and eight straight on the road. They fell four games behind Phoenix for the fourth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference with four games remaining. Phoenix owns the tiebreaker after beating Houston twice this season. Beard shot 10-of-15\, grabbed six rebounds and added four steals. Felicia Ragland and Dominique Canty each scored 11 points for the Comets. Beard scored eight points during the Mystics' 10-2 run early in the second half to open up a 49-40 lead. Sheila Lambert pulled Houston within one point at 54-53 early in the fourth\, but the Comets never got any closer. Thompson scored seven of Houston's first 11 points\, and the Comets led most of the first half before the Mystics took their first lead at 28-26 on two free throws by Stacey Dales-Schuman with 3:04 remaining.

Mystics' Beard flashy in debut Judging by her performance in yesterday's controlled scrimmage against the Charlotte Sting\, prize rookie Alana Beard of the Washington Mystics could become the nation's capital's latest sports star. Beard\, selected by the Mystics with the second pick in last month's WNBA Draft\, clearly was the best player on the floor. Despite being less than 100 percent because of a sore groin\, the 5-foot-11 Beard justified her lofty draft status. More On Story .

He blazed through the minor leagues and was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings as the second overall draft pick. Dionne was quick off the mark in Detroit\, setting a rookie record for scoring with 77 points in his first NHL season. Though he stood at a diminutive 5'8\, Marcel Dionne was a remarkable talent and by the mid-1970s he had emerged as one of the premier scorers in the National Hockey League. In 1975 he left the Detroit Red Wings and signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Kings. The Los Angeles Kings were not the most talented hockey team and they signed him with a $1.5 million contract over 5 years. Dionne flourished in California\, recording six straight 50+ goal seasons as the centerpiece of the "Triple Crown Line" with Dave Taylor and Charlie Simmer. Marcel would win his only Art Ross trophy in 1979 as he edged out Wayne Gretzky by scoring one more goal. He was also named as the center on the NHL's First All-Star team that season. After 12 very successful years in Los Angeles\, Dionne was traded along with Jeff Crossman and a draft pick to the New York Rangers for Bob Carpenter and Tom Laidlaw. Dionne spent parts of the next three seasons with the New York Rangers before retiring in 1988-89. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992 and remains the Los Angeles Kings all-time leader in goals (550)\, assists (757) and points (1\,307). Many experts consider Marcel Dionne to be the best NHL player\, never to have won a Stanley Cup championship.

At the info sessions\, well be teaching them the basics of fencing: The different weapons\, footwork\, and equipment. Theyll get a chance to meet the captains and eboard\, and if they want to\, they can stick around after the info sessions to meet the rest of the team. The info sessions will be held on: Monday\, September 9th\, 8:00 PM  9:30 PM Tuesday\, September 10th\, 8:00 PM  9:30 PM and Wednesday\, September 11th\, 8:00 PM  9:30 PM We will have regular practice on each day from 9:30 PM onwards\, as well as on Thursday from 8:30 PM to 11:00 PM\, as usual.  See you all next week! Neel Dhanesha BUFC President  By BU Fencing Officers | Posted in General | Comments (0) My Final Love Letter to the Boston University Fencing Club May 3\, 2013 at 2:20 PM Eight years ago\, this November\, my mother brought to me during breakfast an interesting article about fencing and its growing popularity in New Jersey. Like most 14 year olds\, the only thing that had interest to me about this sport was sword fighting and being a three musketeerand that was basically it. A sport that is mainly one on one and not really team based was not too interesting to me\, as someone who played recreational soccer for most of his life. I quickly learned that my high school was having open tryouts for a fencing team\, which was about to enter its first season. Why not\, I told myself and after a week of using muscles whose pain I had never experienced in my life\, I was a part of the Junior Varsity Fencing Team\, fencing foil\, at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. The rest\, as they say\, is history. Four years later\, when deciding on college\, I did a search on the four schools I had to decide on if fencing was offered. While at first I would have never put fencing into consideration for college\, the more I thought about it\, how could I just forget about a sport that I fell in love during four years of high school? The results: two had varsity teams\, one had no team\, and one had a very interesting website. That interesting website\, one that discussed some strange game called Glove Game\, was one of the final parts of my decision making process and before I knew it\, I was shipping up to Boston. With over eight years of fencing\, Ive held many titles: Junior Varsity C-Strip\, Varsity B-Strip\, and Mens Foil Captain in High School; Mens Foil Captain\, Treasurer and finally President in college. In all those years\, no title meant more to me than to be simply a teammate and this of course could not be truer than during my time with the Boston University Fencing Club. This clubthere are simply too many words to describe it. Since that first day practice in September 2009 to this last week of practice in May 2013\, Ive seen the growth of (and I quote the words of a USACFC official) one of the most well respected fencing clubs in the nation. Hearing these words\, while the President of this wonderful team\, was my motivation for what has been the most successful year our club has ever been through\, with of course Nationals and the 1st ever Alumni Tournament being the two highlights. The experiences weve had through these four years\, during practice\, tournaments or any other social activity\, are so varied and wonderful that Id be hard pressed to put them all in writing. Every senior graduating\, Im sure\, can agree with me that well miss this huge family were brought up during our unfortunately short four years as a part of the BUFC. This team has given me so much that it will be impossible to give back equally as much\, especially the best and lifelong friends I have made. While come graduation I will be leaving this great city\, I want each and every member of the BUFC to know that there is no way in hell I will forget about you. I plan on making many trips up to Boston\, so while I wont be a permanent fixture in the Three Court gym\, the Multipurpose Rooms or the Cage anymore\, or my StuVi 1 apartment\, you havent seen the last of me. Stay classy and keep me proud\, both on and off the strip. Love\, your 2012-2013 President\, Ralph Conserva By BU Fencing Officers | Posted in Tournament | Comments (0) And thats a Wrap April 21\, 2013 at 10:07 AM Well\, with Nationals behind us and a successful 1st Annual Alumni Tournament\, our season is officially over. While practices will be much more laid back from now until the end of the semester\, we still look forward to another exciting season as it will be quickly approaching. With that said\, we now have a new e-board for next school year\, which consists of: Neel Dhanesha  President Cara Martone  Vice President Austin Walker  Treasurer Kelly Miller  Sports Information Director From one President to the newly elected e-board\, I wish you all the best of luck next season. Ill be sure to post my final love letter to this team as graduation draws near. Until then\, thanks for stopping by!

A vintage display from drivers Marco Attard and Alexander Sims\, as well as swift pit work from the Barwell Motorsport crew\, ensured a clean sweep of honours for their BMW Z4 GT3 at the Northamptonshire venue.  Their weekend began in perfect fashion when Attard and Sims combined to take pole position in Saturdays qualifying session. The Ecosse pairing produced an aggregate lap time of 2m46.786s\, putting them more than four tenths clear of their closest competitors.  Heavy overnight rain gave way to sunny mid-morning skies\, ensuring that the race began on a largely dry circuit. Taking the green flag at the head of the field\, Attard maintained the lead into turn one but slipped behind the Aston Martin of Andrew Howard later in the lap.  Following a brief Safety Car period Attard then went on the attack\, seizing the advantage and passing Howard for top spot 20 minutes into the two-hour contest.  Now in control of the race\, reigning drivers champion Attard drove a measured stint at the head of the field\, eventually bringing the car into the pits shortly before half-distance to hand over to Sims.  The Ecosse machine was destined to lose the lead in the pits due to an extra 10 seconds on their stop time following a third place finish at Oulton Park last month.  But having watched his team-mate deliver an excellent stint Sims was in no mood to surrender victory. Exiting the pits in P2\, some 10 seconds shy of new leader Daniel Lloyd\, the former McLaren Autosport BRDC Award winner produced a series of fastest laps to quickly close up on the rear of the Aston Martin.  Passing would prove a different affair with the Aston defending robustly from the Ecosse machine\, but after several laps of pressure Sims work paid off as Lloyd made a mistake that allowed the BMW to assume top spot. Next time across the line Sims lead was a little under five seconds.  That increased to more than nine seconds over the next few laps before a second Safety Car period wiped out his advantage with 20 minutes left to run. But Sims was unmatched aboard the Z4. When the track went green again he made rapid work of rebuilding his lead\, producing a stellar first lap and edging away thereafter. His margin at the chequered flag was a shade under 10 seconds\, capping a perfect display from the Scottish squad.  Marco Attard: Were really pleased. I went deep at one point and Andrew [Howard] got past me\, but he returned the favour later so I was able to take advantage. Then I could hand over to Alexander and didnt have to worry about it because hes just the best!  Alexander Sims: It all felt pretty good in my little bubble! Fair play to Daniel [Lloyd]\, he did a really good job defending so the first 20 minutes were great fun. After I got through it was pretty plain sailing\, so I just got my head down and pushed on.  Mark Lemmer: It was great to bounce back from Oulton Park with pole\, fastest lap and the win. The fact that it was such a difficult start to the season pushed us even more to turn it around and I think we really deserve this. Were very much looking forward to Silverstone now.  Ecosse drivers Attard and Sims now head the British GT Drivers standings\, while the team assume second in their championship. The Scottish outfit will be looking for more of the same when the series resumes in four weeks time at Silverstone (May 30/31).

Hes learned to no longer get his hopes up\, and now simply focus on the task at hand rather than the hypothetical scenario to which it could lead. So why is it that  as he prepares for a showdown with fellow former 140 lb. titlist Chris Algieri at Barclays Center in Brooklyn\, New York (Friday\, Spike TV\, 9:00 p.m. ET)  the greater conversation piece seems to center around whether or not it will finally lead to a long-coveted showdown with Floyd Mayweather? There are plenty of theories abound\, but Khan isnt in the mood to hear them. Look\, there's people putting this fight down\, and I don't know why\, Khan (30-3\, 19KOs) says of a bout more than a few in the industry believe to be a mismatch.

     Welcome The House The Garden Bed & Breakfast Self Catering Connemara Ponies Forestry Finding Us     Stallions Connemara Breeders Association Connemara Type Bruckless Ponies  Connemara Ponies at Bruckless House  Bruckless ponies are integral to the way of life at Bruckless House\, with the original stable building pre-dating the construction of the house. Bruckless House Farm is involved in the breeding of quality Connemara ponies: suitable for riding and driving in the rough domain of Donegal: hardy and yet with a kindly streak and friendly dispositions. In the present herd\, some of the ponies are registered with Dressage Ireland\, performing dressage at preliminary levels. Performance has always been the bottom line in Connemara Pony production here: the Evans brothers\, Alexander and William rode their ponies from Bruckless to Clifden in 1987\, covering the long road in six days before entering the ponies into the rings. They rode Sweetwall Wanda (8389) and Bruckless Gaffalla (G1204) respectively\, selling both ponies at Clifden that year. A further demonstration of the pony's worth was in 1997 when the family drove the stallion Davog in a 1889 gig from home to Clifden - a lovely experience for everyone concerned. At present\, the Bruckless herd comprises of the following: Robin's Gift (M8781) b.1987 brood mare. Bruckless Emer (M11046) b.1995 riding/jumping/driving/brood mare. Bruckless Hannah (SR30) b.2000 Brood mare Linsfort Boy (S1105) b.1999 Stallion/driving Bruckless Eoin (G2189) b.1996 Gelding/riding/driving. Bruckless Excel (G3056) b.1998 Gelding/under training.

fault page fault page A hard and fast look at the New York Yankees February 26\, 2008 phil hughes wants a player number ending in 5 Dear Carl Pavano: Give Phil Hughes your number. posted by weatherall at 9:47 PM 0 comments links to this post January 10\, 2007 a starting rotation without roger clemens I'm against having Roger Clemens rejoin the Yankees. Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens get along very well. They go to workouts together\, and both joined the Houston Astros in the same offseason. Now Pettitte is back with the Yankees\, and that's a great thing. I'm so pleased to have him back. Roger pitched an abbreviated season last year. He joined the Astros during the season\, saving himself some of the wear and tear that might push him toward retirement. I'm sure he can be an effective starter this year. Roger is in possession of one of the most important baseball player characteristics: passion. A player that puts passion before ego is going to strengthen those around himself\, win or lose. Due to past mistakes with pitching recruitment\, we know what happens when a guy driven by ego loses a game. Roger sounds like a great pitcher on paper. So why would it be bad for the Yankees to bring him back? The Yankees have two young\, important pitchers: Wang and Igawa. What those two guys need is mentoring from more experienced pitchers\, like Mussina and Pettitte. That's the definition of critical relationships among the starting pitchers. If Clemens is around\, Pettitte will spend time with him\, and less time with the new guys. And that can produce negative impact in the long run. Andy doesn't need to better himself. He just needs to train\, study batters\, and be ready to pitch his game. He doesn't need mentoring\, he needs to do it. Don't get me wrong; of course the Yankees have a manager and a pitching coach. But it will take support and guidance from peers as well as superiors to achieve what needs to be done this year. posted by weatherall at 7:41 PM 1 comments links to this post January 04\, 2007 the modified baseballs that mlb denies I'm fascinated by a couple of images recently released by a company called Universal Medical Systems. They obtained some of MLB's baseballs from the 1998 season and performed CT scans on them. Here are links to the images: Mark McGwire's 70th homerun baseball Several baseballs from the 1998 season Hopefully these links will last. Anyway\, what the images show is that the rubberized core of the baseball was bigger than usual\, and an unexplained synthetic rubber ring was around the core. Major League Baseball officials insist that the formation of the official game baseballs has been the same for decades. For a rubber ring inside a baseball to be a factor in an at-bat\, the batter would probably have to hit a portion of the ring directly\, causing extra compaction of the ball upon contact and providing additional travel force upon re-expansion. The baseball would have a slightly higher probability of traveling slightly further than a ball that lacked the rubber ring. Baseball (object) article on Wikipedia posted by weatherall at 9:50 PM 0 comments links to this post January 03\, 2007 andy pettitte returns to the bronx Andy Pettitte will earn $16 million in 2007 to be a starter for the New York Yankees. I think this represents an excellent move by the Yankees: they get an established performer and pin him with high (but not unreasonable) expectations. A lefty starter with an effective pick-off move\, Pettitte will return to New York expecting admiration while at the same time expecting to have to prove himself all over again. Randy Johnson no longer owns the title of lefty Yankees starter. He's being made redundant in an employment system carefully protected by a strong union. His name is generating phone calls to GM Brian Cashman\, and believe me\, not a moment too soon. That was a bit of a back-handed way of speaking my mind\, so let me be clearer: Randy Johnson\, pack your things and hand over your uniform. posted by weatherall at 8:52 PM 1 comments links to this post January 01\, 2007 respect for cory lidle Rest in peace\, Cory Lidle. I was immediately aware of the tragedy\, but I decided to maintain Fault Page's "closed" status until January 2007 as originally stated. Now we can get back to business\, one thing at a time. Cory Lidle was a bonus within the deal for Bobby Abreu. Cory was a big contributor\, keeping the starting lineup together down the stretch. Nobody wanted to see him leave like this. posted by weatherall at 10:06 AM 0 comments links to this post    Links MLB.com Yankees.com YES Network Previous Posts phil hughes wants a player number ending in 5 a starting rotation without roger clemens the modified baseballs that mlb denies andy pettitte returns to the bronx respect for cory lidle sorry\, we're closed pitching change in the 3rd reaction to the division series i hope joe hears this pedro exits Archives January 2006 February 2006 March 2006 April 2006 May 2006 June 2006 July 2006 August 2006 September 2006 October 2006 January 2007 February 2008   => /Top/Sports/Basketball/Women/College_And_University/Ncaa_Division_I/Big_Ten_Conference/Iowa

Its unique skills and special techniques deal with updating and adaptations to handle new violent situations.

Those that charge much less fitthe old adage of you get what you pay for.  Many associations that charge much less are small organizations that cannot offer you any real support\, they are selling paper.

As many of you know the world Percheron congress was held in October. It was great to see such world class horses so close to us for once. I truly feel that all of our members who attended and exhibited at the Congress\, represented our association wonderfully. Personally I had a blast. I'm sure others did as well. Some of our members even came home with first place ribbons and trophies. It was great to make new friends from near and far\, who share the same love for the Percheron horse. I would like to thank Brian and Stacie Lynch for putting on a world class show. I'm sure there were many sleepless nights and endless phone calls and emails. Also a thanks to Bill and Terry Clark\, and Tom and Shannon Stevens for manning the hospitality booth at the congress. Also I would personally like to thank every single one of our board members of our club\, you have shown me that with fellowship and determination we can weather the storm. In closing\, I hope everyone has a very Merry (Yes\, I'm gonna say it) CHRISTMAS !!!!!!! And a safe and happy New Year.

With tees to suit golfers of all ability Garnant Golf Club is a truly enjoyable test of golf in a stunning area of natural beauty. Perched on the hillside above the sleepy former mining town of the same name\, Garnant boasts some of the most dramatic views of any golf club in the country. Its easy to forget about a double bogey or a three putt whilst youre overlooking the idyllic Black Mountains of the Brecon Beacons with native birds of prey soaring in the skies above. Oh\, and the golf course itself isnt too bad either  boasting USGA spec greens and tees\, this relatively new test of Welsh golf was honoured in 2003 being named Wales best new golf club and again in 2004 by the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI) winning their environmental award. From the back tees this truly unique experience measures over 6\,500 yards and is a great test for even the lowest handicapper\, yet the more forward tees will set up a much more subdued challenge allowing both mid and high handicappers chance to give more attention the spectacular greens  without doubt one of Wales Best Kept Golfing Secrets that should be sampled and appreciated by everyone with the opportunity to do so. And what better way to relax and reminisce about all the putts made and putts missed than on the magnificent decking overlooking the breathtaking (particularly at sunset) and historic Amman Valley.

Sponsorship Opportunities Enquire Scott Mitchell Exhibitions Enquire / Book DCDA's Trophy Supplier >> Visit Website Dorset's Home Venue Get Directions Cleveland v Dorset Report Weekend of the 25th-26th of April saw Dorset making the long journey to Thornaby Sports and Leisure Club the home of Cleveland County Darts. The venue was ideal plenty of practice boards and a nice stage and viewing area one of the best Venues we have been to. Most of the Dorset team travelled up on the Friday some by plane from Southampton Airport the others driving the 300 plus miles\, such is the commitment within the county of Dorset. We are only a small county but both the team and individuals have made significant achievements over the years. We have the England captain and World Champion Scott Mitchell in the team as well as youngster Daniel Perry playing for the England youth squad and ex England youth player (too old now) Thomas Chant. We should also mention both Sherborne and Bournemouth Ladies team who have won the Champions Cup. We should also mention the football club BOURNEMOUTH FC who for the first time in it's history have just earned promotion as Champions to the Premier league. So how did we get on? Our women's B team has seen a few changes this season and haven't as yet really shown the consistency we all know they are capable of. Cleveland's B ladies were bottom of the league so hopes were high. We lost the first two games both Wendy Lamb and Donna Mabbatt struggled to hit a double both losing 0-3 then Lin Bellingham got us our 1st win with a great 124 out shot. Lisa Prowse also struggled with her doubles losing 0-3. Wins for Claire Whatley our woman of the match (again) winning 3-1 with a 17.10 average always consistent a good steady player that won't be rushed and it works for her\, and Sally Old whose own darts broke bought a new set of darts that very morning took them up on stage with her and won 3-0\, now that's brave. So not the best of starts 3-3\, it could have been so much better if not for the doubles!!!! Bring on the men's B. On paper nothing really to separate the two teams so we knew it was going to be close. The men got us off to a great start with wins for Mark Grimes\, Daniel Perry a young 13 year old up from our youth team who got his 1st County win for the Men's team and probably the loudest cheer of the day. He even had his mother in tears but took the win well what a find he will be in later games he held his nerve and hit that winning double. Lee Turle followed back to winning ways with a 3-0 win. There then followed losses for Alan Ayres\, Terry Gowans and Matty Yarrow who had his chances but missed doubles leaving the match all square again at 3-3. A win from Lee Edwardson put us back in front\, John Clark lost 1-3 then wins from captain Mark Porter playing like we know he can and Matty Woodhouse put us two games ahead. Steve O'Marah despite hitting a 24.45 average lost but we saved the best game till last\, Robby Morris winning 3-1 hitting a 27.21 average and was our man of the match. The men's B just edging it 7-5. A two game lead going into Sunday would that be enough? Day 2. Now Cleveland's A ladies were bottom of the table so hopes were high. A great start from our ladies wins for Sarah Chick\, Julie Frampton and Cath Campbell our women of the match winning 3-1 with a 19.80 average. Julie Boggust and Suzy Trickett both lost but a win for Trina Perry (Daniel's mother) gave us a 4-2 win. Now a 4 game lead going into the men's A sounds a lot but Cleveland have their own superstars with the likes of Glen Durrant (no 1 in running county averages) Richard Corner\, Allan Edwards and Peter Frewer playing for them no wonder they are top of the Men's A table. Up 1st Ryan Gowans who played well match going to a deciding leg but Allan Edwards was just too good hitting a 27.84 average\, then Richard Corner (Cleveland) poked a winning 27.45 average against Robbie Martin. Up next Scotty Dog Mitchell who played Scott Chatterton what a game that was Scotty dog missing darts at a double to win 4-2 game going to a last leg shoot out which Scott Chatterton won so we found ourselves 0-3 down. Did our heads go down? NO it's a team game and every player who puts his toe to that oche tries his best to win. Next Matt Read (who along with Sarah Chick his partner\, began their journey early Saturday morning\, broke down on the motorway got towed home\, got a hire car and started again arriving at the hotel at 7pm now that's commitment) took the match to a deciding 7th leg which he won. John Bothamley up next who had said he wouldn't mind playing Glen Durrant (be careful what you wish for) well he got his wish. Glen hit the highest average of the weekend 28.69 and beat John 4-1. Next Steve Penney who won 4-2 followed by Nigel Lamb who won 4-0 with a 27.83 and was our man of the match. This gave us hope\, trailing 3-4\, Tim Clothier up next and took it to a deciding 7th leg a little unlucky having just one dart at tops to win so close. Then followed losses for Sean McMurray\, Steve Earley. Kevin Smith who had won his last 4 games\, took it to a deciding leg but Michael Evans (Cleveland) poked the winning double and for the 1st time Cleveland were in front 18-17 with just Thomas Chant left to play. Thomas (The Robot) Chant had just returned from the German Open where he reached the last 32 beating The Count Ted Hankey on his route. Thomas yet another player who has emerged through the youth system. A key game Thomas never looked like losing winning 4-2 to get us the draw. Made the long trip home more bareable. MARTIN'S HIGHLIGHTS Some say I'm mad driving all that way "JUST FOR A GAME OF DARTS" but I don't think so such is my love of the game and my County. Highlights of the weekend for me seeing the two youth players Thomas Chant and Daniel Perry both doing the business. Dorset showing what a friendly side we really are with both the team manager\, John Clark and Men's Captain Mark Porter helping Cleveland out by doing some MC work for them. One match left to play and that's at home to Oxfordshire weekend 30th - 31st May. We play out of the Conservative Club (monkey house) in upper Parkstone\, come and see what I get so excited about its just like watching darts on the T.V. but with atmosphere. Come and see our England captain and world champion Scott Mitchell\, and of course OUR GREAT DORSET COUNTY SQUAD.

Scott\, 50\, has over 26 years of NBA experience\, including 14 seasons as a player\, 10 and a half seasons as an NBA head coach and two seasons as an assistant coach. In his 14-year playing career\, he played a key role in helping the Los Angeles Lakers win three NBA Championships (1985\, 1987\, and 1988) and as a coach\, led the New Jersey Nets to back-to-back NBA Finals appearances in 2002 and 2003. As a head coach in the NBA\, he has totaled a 371-418 (.470) regular season record and a 33-24 (.579) postseason record. Prior to joining the Cavaliers before the 2010-11 season\, he had served as head coach of the New Orleans Hornets from the beginning of the 2003-04 season through the first nine games of the 2009-10 season\, accumulating a 203-216 (.484) regular season record and a 8-9 (.471) postseason record during his tenure. During the 2007-08 season\, he guided the Hornets to a franchise-record 56 wins during the regular season\, an improvement of 17 games from the 2006-07 season\, and an appearance in the Western Conference Semifinals in the 2008 NBA Playoffs. Scott was named the recipient of the Red Auerbach trophy as the 2007-08 NBA Coach of the Year and during the season\, earned the honor of becoming head coach of the Western Conference All-Star Team\, making him one of just six coaches to earn the honor for both conferences. Scott was also named Western Conference Coach of the Month for January\, making him just the eighth coach in NBA history to earn Coach of the Month honors in both conferences. Scott followed the 2007-08 campaign by leading the Hornets back to the playoffs in 2008-09 and to 49 regular season wins. In his second season with the Hornets during the 2005-06 season\, he helped lead the Hornets to a 38-44 (.463) record\, a 20-game win improvement from his first season in New Orleans\, despite Hurricane Katrina displacing the team from New Orleans and playing in four different home arenas throughout the season. The 20-game turnaround was the NBAs best that season and earned him a top-five finish in the NBAs Coach of the Year balloting that season. Prior to his stint in New Orleans\, Scott led the New Jersey Nets to the most successful run in franchise history as head coach. In his first season in 2000-01\, he spearheaded a rebuilding New Jersey team to a 26-56 (.317) record before guiding them to a franchise-high and Eastern Conference best 52-30 (.634) record and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals in 2001-02. The 26-win improvement marked the sixth-largest in NBA history and the team won its first Atlantic Division title\, earning Scott head coaching honors for the Eastern Conference All-Star Team during the 2002 All-Star Game. The following season in 2002-03\, he guided the Nets back to the Finals after winning a second consecutive Atlantic Division title and 49 games during the regular season. Scott served as an assistant coach under current Houston Rockets Head Coach Rick Adelman for two seasons (1998-2000) with the Sacramento Kings before joining the Nets. In his two-year stint in Sacramento\, the Kings posted their first back-to-back winning seasons (27-23 and 44-38) in 20 years. Prior to his successful coaching career\, the Inglewood\, CA native enjoyed an outstanding NBA playing career. Selected in the first round of the 1983 NBA Draft (4th overall) by the San Diego Clippers\, Scott played 14 seasons with three different teams (the Los Angeles Lakers\, Indiana Pacers and Vancouver Grizzlies)\, winning three NBA titles (1985\, 1987 and 1988) as an integral starter on the Lakers Showtime era teams. In 1\,073 games (717 starts)\, the 6-4 guard averaged 14.1 points on .482 shooting\, 2.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 28.1 minutes per game. In 183 postseason games (122 starts)\, he posted career averages of 13.4 points on .482 shooting\, 2.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 29.3 minutes per game. A consummate winner\, Scott experienced only two losing seasons as a player as his teams reached the playoffs in 13 of his 14 seasons. His 183 career playoff games ranks 11th all-time in NBA history. After retiring from the NBA\, Scott played one season overseas (1997-98)\, winning a championship for Pananthinaikos in Greece before moving onto coaching. Scott attended Arizona State\, where he finished his career as the schools all-time leading scorer with 1\,752 points. As a senior\, he was named First Team All-Pac 10 after averaging 21.6 points\, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. He is a member of Arizona State Universitys Hall of Fame and was Arizona States first inductee into the Pac-10 Hall of Honor in 2002. On Feb. 17\, 2011\, Scott had his jersey retired at Arizona State. After his playing career\, Scott continued to broaden his rsum during the 2003-04 season when he served as a studio analyst for ABCs NBA telecasts and during the 2009-10 season\, he was an analyst for ESPNs coverage of the NBA. Off the court\, his non-profit organization\, The Byron Scott Childrens Fund\, has raised more than $6 million over the past decade\, with the proceeds going to various childrens charities. He and his wife\, Anita\, have three children: Thomas\, LonDen and DaRon.

The Arabian Horse Society of Australia HOME HOT NEWS STUD BOOK MARKETPLACE CONTACT Top news THE 2016 AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ARABIAN CHAMPIONSHIPS The Board of The AHSA Ltd. wishes to announce that The 2016 Australian National Arabian Championships will be held in NSW at the Sydney International Equestrian Centre commencing Thursday 31st March\, concludingSunday 3rd April 2016 andincluding the Australian Youth & Non-Pro Championships.  THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ARABIAN CHAMPIONSHIPS AND THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ARABIAN YOUTH & NON-PRO CHAMPIONSHIPS The Board has considered the many difficulties that have become evident with regard to running the Championships. One of the biggest issues is finding and securing a venue suitable for such a large show as there are very few suitable venues in Australia. The other consideration is the cost due to the number of days required to run the event. Therefore after considerable consideration it has become evident that the most viable way forward is to take the positive step to create the flexibility and possibility for two Championship Shows. The Arabian and Arabian Derivative horses will continue to compete at the Australian National Arabian Championships with the considerations for the flexibility of a Non Pro and Youth designated show  so named the Australian National Arabian Non Pro & Youth Championships with the possibility of being a completely separate show. Please refer to the template for this show as it is a separate proposal. Groups or affiliates may tender for one or both Shows. The document is designed to provide consistency\, sustainability and longevity for the event\, so that it may retain its uniqueness and integrity for many years to come.

Specials Log in to view our specials online and print them to bring to the course with you.  Welcome to Northumberland Links Golf Club The 6313 (white tees)\, par 72 course\, minutes from Pugwash\, overlooking the Northumberland Strait\, is one of Atlantic Canadas most picturesque and challenging layouts. Dont let its length fool youprevailing winds\, rolling fairways\, well placed bunkers and lightning fast greens make it a true test and enjoyable experience. The sea scenery combines with the beautiful landscaping of the grounds to create an atmosphere perfect for a round of golf. The greens are made from thin cross creeping bluegrass\, and are designed to challenge even the most serious players\, while the fairways are made from an annual bluegrass\, common to most courses in the province. In addition to providing an unparalleled experience for golfers\, the Northumberland Links also plays an important role in the communities along the north shore. About the course The facility is within easy reach for residents of Cumberland and Colchester County and only two hours from the Halifax-Dartmouth area. The course is one of contrast\, ranging from the link type holes directly on the Northumberland Strait to majestic tree framed fairways and almost tranquil meadow like settings\, most with a spectacular view of the strait.

Cincinnati Unicyclists  Cincinnati Unicyclists  news meetings photos links contact us  Monday\, January 15\, 2007 I guess nobody can accuse me of posting too often in 2006. We did pick up a new regularly-attending member and have hopes for a few more in the new year. This winter has been warm and wet so far; we'll be out again if the weather is warm (45 degrees F. or better) and dry. Just posted two new photos of a ride through Sharon Woods last fall. posted by mjh at 9:41 PM Sunday\, September 25\, 2005 As my schedule will take me out of town this week\, look for extra-light attendance at meetings today and next Sunday. I really want to reconstitute this group; if you are in the area and want to ride anyway\, please try to come out to Winton Woods on a Sunday afternoon. One of these Sundays\, we'll get together and fall back into a rhythm of regular meetings. posted by mjh at 7:26 AM Saturday\, August 20\, 2005 Finally got my daughter on a unicycle this week at COSI Columbus. Hopefully\, that will prove to be a good introduction to the sport. The unicycle rides a cable strung well above the ground floor of the museum; it's a fun ride despite the 250 lb. counterweight hanging below the uni. I posted pictures of the high-wire unicycle and a few from my ride earlier this summer through Cade's Cove in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The loop road around Cade's Cove is closed to motor traffic twice a week (at least during the summer months) and is perfect for an easy uni ride. Definitely worth a look if you find yourself near Townsend\, TN. posted by mjh at 12:52 PM Saturday\, August 13\, 2005 I can hardly believe it's been so long since I've posted anything here. I suppose being out of town for two months didn't help any. Since I've been back\, it's been awfully hot and I'm afraid I haven't made it to Winton Woods on more than one Sunday. Hopefully\, things will start cooling off and we'll be able to enjoy the park in the fall. I just posted more than a few pictures from NAUCC 2005 to the picture page. It was nice to have a digital camera this year--I was a little behind the times in 2001. Sorry to have caught the only other regular Cincinnati Unicyclist on the track after having DQed in the wheel walk race--I didn't get a good exposure of Dirk on any other shot. I should have been on the track myself this year\, but I wimped out. posted by mjh at 4:15 PM Sunday\, October 17\, 2004 Special ride planned for Sunday\, October 24 at Miami Whitewater Forest . Never been before\, but I hear that the bike trail should make for a nice long ride. Hopefully there will be one main entrance and we will find each other easily enough. This ride replaces the standard weekly ride. Same time\, different place. Update : I found a useful map of the park in my copy of Walking Cincinnati . Looks like the parking lot for the Bird museum is close to trailheads for both the bike trail and the Oakleaf Trail\, so I suggest we try to meet there at 3:00. Directions: Take I-74 to Dry Fork Rd.\, turn right on Dry Fork Rd.\, and right again on West Rd. to park entrance. posted by mjh at 2:55 PM Saturday\, August 21\, 2004 Fair warning...I'll be out of town this weekend and next so attendance at the meetings will be light. posted by mjh at 9:33 AM Wednesday\, July 07\, 2004 The Cicadas have been gone for a while now\, so let's get back out on one wheel this summer. I meant to take some pictures of cicadas I had crushed on my tire at Winton Woods\, but I kept forgetting to bring my camera. We surely need some new pictures on this site. Anyway\, I wanted to post fair warning that our small group will be one rider short for the next two weeks as I take my summer vacation to beautiful Buffalo\, NY. posted by mjh at 7:29 AM  news | meetings | photos | links | contact us => /Top/Sports/Basketball/College_And_University/Ncaa_Division_I/Atlantic_10_Conference/St._Joseph'S

I have been working hard this summer to ensure a smooth transition that will lead to a strong and successful program in the future. Taylour has been an integral part of our golf program for the past six years and we are pleased she is assuming the position of head coach. She knows the College and the program well and what we stand for. She has earned this opportunity through her dedication to her sport and school\, states Athletic Director Terry Bocian.   Dan Pupel - Swing Instructor  Dan Pupel is no stranger to Aquinas College. Pupel has an affiliation with the college that dates back nearly 50 years. He was a standout performer on the mens team from 1954-1957. During that time\, the team had three undefeated seasons and Pupel was a strong leader on those teams. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in History and went on to earn a Masters Degree in Education from Michigan State University. Upon graduation\, Pupel turned professional and was an assistant pro at Kent Country Club in Grand Rapids\, MI. During this period he coached the Aquinas College mens team to three outstanding seasons from 1959-61.  Pupel has always considered himself a teacher. Whether it was in the classroom teaching history and english for 30 years at Forest Hills Central High School\, or on the golf course. Pupel comments\, I have always enjoyed working with young people and challenging them to get the best out of themselves. I knew a long time ago that teaching was in my blood. I never second guessed myself and I really enjoy working with the young women at Aquinas College.  While at Forest Hills Central High School\, Pupel coached boys' golf for 30 years. He also coached the girls' golf team for 15 years. During this time\, his teams won 25 league championships (including eleven in a row with the boys' squad from 1979-1990)\, 14 regional championships and eight state runner-up finishes. Pupel was named Michigan Golf Coach of the Year three times and was inducted into the Michigan Coaches Hall of Fame in 1991.  Dan and his wife\, Sheila (Smith '58)\, a professor who passed away in 1999\, had five children and\, at one time\, four of them attended Aquinas simultaneously. All are Aquinas graduates. In 1988\, Pupel was awarded the prestigious "Outstanding Teacher Award" from the University of Chicago. He served two terms as a Kent County Commissioner and six years on the Aquinas Emeritus Board. Pupel possesses an intense love of golf\, and is still both an avid player and a patient teacher of the game.  For all of Coach Pupels contributions to Aquinas College\, he was inducted into the prestigious Aquinas College Hall of Fame in 2007. Pupel guided the Saints to their first ever WHAC conference championship in his first year guiding the program. He received WHAC Coach of the Year that season. Pupel comments\, I have always loved Aquinas College. It is an extremely important part of my life and my families life. Ive been blessed to have such wonderful young ladies on the golf team.  Season Preview The Lady Saints are awaiting their chance to bring the WHAC title back to Aquinas after finishing third at the conference championship last April.

Do you teach or study self-defense? Are you a healing arts practitioner? Do you love your art and dream of sharing it with other women? Do you want to experience a supportive learning environment? Do you want to further the participation of women and girls in these arts? You are in the right place. The NWMAF is a community of women who\, like yourself\, train in martial and healing arts and self-defense. From Aikido to Zujitsu\, empty-hand to weapons\, self-defense to healing arts\, our members span the gamut. Join us! NWMAF members reap the benefits of practice and study of our health\, self-confidence\, physical fitness\, and stress management. Some of us have been training over many decades\, others just a few months. Yet we can all come together and train. To that end\, every summer the NWMAF puts on a Special Training and Self-Defense Instruction Conference. You choose from a variety of classes. Each day brings many sessions and several options: a hard style class\, soft style class\, mat art\, self-defense\, healing arts\, and weapons. Expert trainers tailor their teaching for a wide range of students  from beginners to experts. Take a look around this website\, and feel free to contact us with any questions. We are looking forward to meeting you! The NWMAF is a collection of remarkable women connected by a common passion. I joined the organization in 2004 and attended my first conference in 2006. Since then\, I have discovered the infinite variety of individuals that make up the women in martial arts.  As chair\, I have the good fortune to communicate and team up with accomplished women from all over the world. These women have inspired young people to a passion that changes their lives and spreads positive energy like a drop of water in a pond that ripples outward.  I see the positive change martial arts has created in my life and the lives of students I teach.  The vision I have for the NWMAF\, is that we continue to fulfill our mission of empowering women through martial arts and self-defense training\, by encouraging everyday participation at local schools and training centers.  --Teddie Linder\, Chair\, December 2013 Upcoming events Women's Martial Arts Special Training and Self-Defense Instruction Conference 2015 Wed\, July 15\, 2015  Causeway Bay Hotel & Conference Center\, Lansing Mi SUPER SATURDAY: NWMAF's 1-Day Special Training and Self-Defense Instruction Conference 2015 Sat\, July 18\, 2015  Causeway Bay Inn & Suites\, Lansing\, Michigan 2015 ST/SDIC in Lansing\, Michigan!

Version 2.0 Good Health! CHINESE FITNESS & HEALTH Welcome to our help site for all those interested in health\, fitness and self-defence. Here you will find the most basic information you need\, links\, media references and much more. We hope that you both enjoy and benefit from this. Love & Peace. Home Links Books Tao Tai Chi Qigong Gongfu Yoga Chinese | Fitness & Health Health and fitness does not come in a bottle\, packet or tube\, it is something that you have to work at. Many Chinese systems are time proven. >>> The simple facts are that China has developed fitness and health routines for many hundreds of years before anyone even thought of doing similar in the West. Many Chinese are deep thinkers too\, adding careful consideration to routines and considering important known health factors before launching a new routine on the public. Often\, in the West\, routines are made up from bits and pieces borrowed from an established system\, like yoga or circuit training\, but hurriedly put together by someone who has not had formal training or enough experience. Whereas most traditional Chinese exercise systems have been developed thoroughly and tested or improved over time. What is your view of Chinese fitness? Is it of rows of people all clad in white suits practising Tai Chi in unison on a huge school playing field? Perhaps an image of people doing exercises in the local Park between 5 and 7 a.m.? What ever your view of fitness\, Chinese style\, we hope to provide you here with some simple information which will enlighten you as to what the main elements of it are and also provide some links to where you can find REPUTABLE classes\, books or other resources. If you are looking to improve your diet\, your body strength\, increase or harmonise your energies\, then you have come to the right place. We have information on subjects that are becoming better known in the West and ever more popular. We have web-links too\, these will help you to find something that you are looking for\, perhaps a club in your area where you can learn Tai Chi for Health\, or traditional Kung Fu. Contrary to common belief\, you do not have to go to China to find a good instructor of the skills we talk about here. In China\, just as in the West\, there are the good\, the bad and the indifferent; however\, youd have to travel many more miles in China and look for much longer! There are many good instructors in the UK\, USA and even Europe\, but there are also some which we will not link to. Please feel free to read through the articles and then browse the links. Dont forget to BOOKMARK this page! Welcome to Chinese Fitness & Health. Links Page 2013 Good health is not found\, it is made! In this world today where there is so much poisonous pollution in what we eat\, breath and even the polluted air waves (mobile phone waves) we need to work harder at staying fitter to survive even for a meagre 60 - 80 year life span. => /Top/Sports/Basketball/Women/College_And_University/Ncaa_Division_I/Big_Ten_Conference/Iowa

The Shepherds Arms Football Club was established in the year 2000 and entered the Wakefield Express Sunday League for the season 2001/02. Following mixed seasons - season 2004/05 saw The Mighty Sheps lift their first ever trophy by winning the Division 4 league Cup with an emphatic 5-0 win over Flanshaw and securing promotion in 2nd place to Division 3 . Even in the previous years when the Shepherds Arms had a team\, trophies always eluded them. Hopefully this has changed for good. Shepherds Arms FC Shepherds Arms FC was the first of the teams to be formed and plays its games within the Wakefield & District Sunday League. The past seasons have seen The Mighty Sheps gain promotion only to drop back to the 4th Division the following season and then to have by far their best ever season. The League Cup is the first trophy that Shepherds Arms FC have won in their entire history and things are looking as they are going from strength to strength. This season - 2005/06 has seen several new players added to the team to try and ensure their rise through the divisions and win some more of that so treasured silverware. Shepherds Arms FC is currently run by Steve Rowbottom - aka - The Fat Bald Kid. Steve is a Director of Precision E Ltd and currently sponsors the Sunday team in their now familiar Black & White kit. AFC Shepherds Arms AFC Shepherds Arms is our Saturday team which plays its games within The Wakefield & District FA League. The team\, formed in 2005 following the dispansion of Wakefield City IV's\, are currently enjoying their football in Division 1 and hopefully looking to go to the heady heights of the Premier Division in seasons to come. Following the transfer of all the players\, AFC Shepherds Arms are comfortable in their first season in Division 1 and have been unlucky with several results. The team is jointly run at present\, with last seasons Manager - Chris (Duzza) Durham and Steve Rowbottom - aka - The Fat Bald Kid - yes its him again. AFC Shepherds Arms play in all blue and are sponsored directly by the pub. | About Us | Site Map | Website Design | Contact Us | 2003 Shepherds Arms Football Club => /Top/Shopping/Home_And_Garden/Accessories/Glas

CaribbeanCricket.com - The Independent Voice of West Indies Cricket News Forums Login/Register Main Search Forums Feedback Site Map  RSS  Atom Domestic Scores Coming Matches Live Scores no matches Tale of a terrific Wed\, May 27\, '15  It is not in Shivnarine Chanderpaul's nature to give things away. At least in the business of cricket. Forty-nine times in 280 innings\, he left the crease with his wicket still in tact. No top player in the history of the game has been unbeaten so many times. The closest to him is South African Jacques Kallis with 40 not outs. It was as if the 22 yards of turf was Shiv's home\, his favourite place in the whole world. It didn't matter in what country\, what island\, what city those 22 yards happened to be found. When Shiv got to the middle and extracted one of the bails from its groove in a stump\, stooped down and hammered an indentation in the ground to mark his guard\, it was like him laying down a foundation; he was setting up house. I have lost count of the number of debates in various media centres that I have been privy to\, when West Indies have been down to nine\, ten\, Jack and Chanderpaul\, and people have raged over his refusal to protect the tail. Over the years\, the faces changed\, the abilities of the batsmen varied\, but Shiv stuck to his measured script\, taking his time. At the end\, he was the last man standing\, still at "home" win lose or draw. Often it was 'lose.' That mindset\, that appreciation for his wicket was something several of his West Indies teammates over the years needed to emulate\, but sadly didn't. The Windies might have saved or even won a few more Tests had they followed Shiv's lead. 0 comments Holding refutes statements by WICB boss Wed\, May 27\, '15  Former West Indies fast bowler\, turned cricket commentator Michael Holding has refuted statements by President of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB)\, Whycliffe 'Dave' Cameron that he has turned down requests to do television commentary. During a WICB town-hall meeting on Friday at the University of the West Indies\, Cave Hill Campus\, Cameron insisted that the WICB had not banned Holding or veteran broadcaster Tony Cozier from doing television commentary. Instead\, he revealed that Cozier's failing eyesight had been the main reason for his absence\, while Holding's commitments to UK company\, SKY\, had led to him turning down offers by the WICB. "The issue we have with Mr Holding is that our season runs counter to the season in the UK and whenever we ask him to do commentary he is always working with SKY back in the UK\, so as far as they are concerned there are no issues\," Cameron had stated. However\, in a reply on Barbados TODAY's website after reading the story which was published on Saturday\, Holding said he had never told the WICB he was unavailable to do television commentary. 9 comments ALLROUND MATTHEWS LEAD WINDIES TO SERIES Wed\, May 27\, '15  COLOMBO\, Sri Lanka\, CMC  West Indies Women secured the three-match T20 series against Sri Lanka women after a dazzling all-round effort by Hayley Matthews spurred them to an easy nine-wicket win in the final match here on Tuesday. Matthews\, with impressive figures of four for 10\, restricted Sri Lanka to 74 runs and scored an unbeaten 32 as her side cruised to victory with 52 balls remaining at the R Premadasa Stadium\, Colombo. The Caribbean women have now wrapped-up the series two-one after losing the opening encounter. Mathews grabbed four Sri Lankan wickets to crush any hopes of a recovery after Anisa Mohammed and her captain\, wicketkeeper Merissa Aguilleira\, conspired to disable the top order.  read more at windiescricket 0 comments Chanderpaul releases Lloyds letter of disbandment May 25\, 2015 Tue\, May 26\, '15  ON Tuesday May 19\, head of the West Indies Cricket Boards (WICB) selection panel\, Clive Lloyd\, in a letter to Shivnarine Chanderpaul\, informed him of his axing from the training squad which is set to oppose Australia in a two-Test series from June 3.Chanderpaul\, a dedicated servant to West Indies Cricket for the past 21 years\, released the letter along with a conversation between him and the recently appointed Head Coach of the side\, Phil Simmons\, about his current situation. The letter stated that Lloyd made several attempts to contact the left-handed batsman following the final Test against England which ended on May 4\, to have discussions with him before he wrote the letter\, but that was to no avail. In the letter\, Lloyd said\, Following your meeting with the coach\, Mr Simmons on 4th May 2015\, and his subsequent Whatsapp conversations with you\, I tried to contact you on several occasions but you had already left for Guyana. He continued: I rang your home telephone number in Guyana and left my details with a male member of the house requesting that you contact me\, which he promised to do. To date\, you have not returned my calls and it is rather unfortunate as I did want to have the opportunity to have a discussion with you prior to writing this letter to you. The Coach and the Selectors have studied your stats from the last 6 Test matches to date\, 3 against South Africa and 3 against England. You batted 11 innings and had an aggregate of 183 runs at an average of 16.64. In determining the squad for the series against Australia\, the selectors have decided to move on with younger players for the future. I therefore regret to inform you that the coach and selectors have decided to omit you from the squad for that series. You have been a great player for the West Indies and have given excellent service to the game and to West Indies supporters all over the world. We hope that your skills will be utilised in the future and we wish you all the very best. We also wish to thank you for your contribution to this game which gave us all our upward mobility.  read more at Guyana chronicle 11 comments Taylor\, Dottin star in series-levelling win Mon\, May 25\, '15  Deandra Dottin's 51 and Stafanie Taylor's unbeaten 49-ball 59\, to go with her 2 for 20 helped West Indies Women beat Sri Lanka Women by eight wickets and level the three-match T20I series 1-1. Chasing 125\, left-arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani claimed the wicket of Hayley Matthews in the second over but Dottin and Taylor put on 101 in 14.4 overs to take the game away from the home team. Dottin fell to Maduri Samudikka in the 17th over after getting to her eighth T20 international fifty but Taylor remained unbeaten to guide West Indies home with seven balls to spare. 0 comments More News May 25\, 2015 Chanderpaul axed for Australia Tests May 24\, 2015 West Indies squad for training camp ahead of Australia series Tiger to play against Australia after being initially dropped Australia will test West Indies' resilience Weak batting\, rain undermine West Indies Women May 23\, 2015 Chanders to miss out against Aussies May 22\, 2015 'IPL Stars Should Not Walk Back Into Test Team' May 21\, 2015 Coach Simmons opens door for IPL quintet Shiv Fate Hangs In Balance TTCB president wants cricket on a Friday May 20\, 2015 West Indies women defend 156 to clinch series Garry Sobers talks about batting innovations and what T20 does to young players ICC advisory panel recommends playing Tests under floodlights May 19\, 2015 Taylor\, Dottin give WIWomen series lead May 18\, 2015 WICB starts series of town-hall meetings to engage public Gayle and KP: dissimilar rebels May 16\, 2015 Do we pick a player to break a record or score runs Chris Gayle returns to Big Bash League after signing with Melbourne Renegades Windies Women crumble to spin as Sri Lanka level series May 14\, 2015 WICB Presidents XI squad for tour match against Australia All content posted on this site is  copyrighted to the original authors and published with their permission.
